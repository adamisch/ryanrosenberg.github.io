<p>ACF is pleased to announced that Susan Ferrari has won the 2014 Dr. N. Gordon Carper Lifetime Achievement Award. Susan has edited ACF Nationals in 2011 and 2012. Since ACF's switch to a centralized paying system, in her role as communications director Susan has tirelessly worked behind the scenes to inform teams about ACF Tournaments, working with them on the registration process, discussing eligibility questions with editors, and in general being the organizational glue that holds ACF together. She is a prominent guiding voice of reason in the collegiate quizbowl community. Congratulations, Susan, and thank you for all of the time and effort you have devoted to collegiate quizbowl.</p>
