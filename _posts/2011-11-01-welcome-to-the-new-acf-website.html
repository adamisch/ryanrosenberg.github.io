<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Welcome to the new ACF website. With the move to Wordpress, we will do a better job of keeping you updated on the happenings of ACF tournaments. Some pages are still under construction, but if you find any inconsistencies or feel like the content is unclear, please don't hesitate to email <a href="mailto:gkandlikar@gmail.com?Subject=ACF">Gautam Kandlikar</a>.</p>
<p>ACF Fall is coming up soon, so I hope you are gearing up for some awesome quizbowl! </p>
