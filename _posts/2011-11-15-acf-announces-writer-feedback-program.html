<p>In September, Jonathan Magin announced ACF's new writer feedback program:</p>
<blockquote><p>On behalf of ACF, I'm very pleased to announce our writer feedback program, which is designed to help quizbowlers of every level improve their writing.</p>
<p>How it works: send up to 5 questions toÂ <a href="mailto:feedback.acf@gmail.com">feedback.acf@gmail.com</a>, along with what level the questions are for and what you'd most like help with. We'll assign a member of ACF to correspond with you and give you feedback on your writing by reading your questions, critiquing them, and suggesting possible changes. We'll also try to answer any questions about writing for quizbowl that you may have.</p>
<p>This program is open to all with no restrictions on who can participate. Everyone who wants to become a better writer, no matter how experienced you are, is welcome.</p>
<p>If you'd like to use these questions at a college tournament, send a preliminary email with no questions attached to ensure that no one playing that tournament is able to see the questions.</p>
<p>Also, if you are interested in ongoing feedback, please only submit one group of questions every two weeks; as a new program, we want to make sure we don't overtax our volunteers.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your questions and helping improve your writing!</p></blockquote>
