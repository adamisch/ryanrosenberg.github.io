          <p>Welcome to the 21st Annual PACE National Scholastic Championship and the 4th Annual David Riley Coaches Conference! It is a pleasure and an honor to host such a great collection of teams from all over the country and to some extent all over the world. Whether this is your school’s first time participating or it has been here many times before, we are happy to have you.</p>

<p>There are so many different people who are essential to make a tournament like this happen and make an organization like PACE work, and I am grateful for their many contributions. Michael Bentley and Fred Morlan deserve high praise for improving PACE many times over the years, especially recently. Tournament Director Ryan Rosenberg, Set Editor Rob Carson, and Event Manager Bernadette Spencer merit special mention for making this year’s tournament work. Many people deserve credit for PACE and the NSC being able to serve high school teams well.</p>

<p>In the interest of making quizbowl better and more welcoming, PACE has worked with other major quizbowl organizations to implement a Misconduct Reporting Form. If anybody at NSC says or does something inappropriate that you want us to know about it, feel free to access the form at http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=21339. We will also have links to the form on our website, www.pace-nsc.org.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/david-riley-coaches-conference/">David Riley Coaches Conference</a> takes place Friday night. We hope you will join us for a wide-ranging discussion of quizbowl. We will talk both about how you can compete better and about how we together can make quizbowl better.</p>

<p>Speaking of how we together can make quizbowl better, PACE is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit which sponsors a variety of programs throughout the year in order to advance our mission of promoting high-quality high school quizbowl. I’d like to highlight two such programs in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/pace-outreach-fund-2016-17/">PACE Outreach Fund</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a grant that individuals and quizbowl organizations can apply for to help recruit new teams to a circuit or to start a circuit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.pace-nsc.org/2017-morgan-costa-rhodes-memorial-scholarship-winner/">Morgan Costa-Rhodes Memorial Scholarship</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a scholarship to help students who are starting college who demonstrate dedication to quizbowl, community service, and financial need.</p>

<p>More details on each of these programs can be found at our website, www.pace-nsc.org. Our website also contains Quizbowl 101, which is a video and collection of articles about quizbowl. You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube.</p>

<p>If you are a graduating senior passionate about high school quizbowl or know someone who is, please let us know. We will be making an open call for new members within the next couple of weeks. You can also email me personally at president@pace-nsc.org.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you so much for attending this year’s NSC. I hope you all have a great tournament.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
David Reinstein</p>

<p>President, PACE</p>
