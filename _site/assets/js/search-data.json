PACE has many objectives: to promote and encourage the growth of quality high school academic tournaments around the country, to provide guidance or assistance to colleges or high schools that wish to organize academic tournaments, to encourage innovation and creativity in academic competition, to establish visibility for college quizbowl programs that run high school tournaments, to foster cooperation among college and high school quizbowl programs in preparation for upcoming regional, state, or national tournaments, to encourage quizbowl teams to participate in tournaments across the country prior to regional, state, or national championships, to promote adequate opportunities for all teams to practice, compete, and socialize among other fellow competitors, to produce the question set for and run the National Scholastic Championship each year.",

    "title": "Cooper Awards",
    "content": "The Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award is an annual award presented by PACE to recognize “a high school academic competition team member, advisor, or organization whose character best promotes the spirit and honor of quiz bowl competition”.  The original Cooper Award was named in honor of Benjamin Cooper, a student at Georgetown Day School who had been named captain of his team prior to his untimely death on August 12, 1997, and has been awarded at every NSC since PACE’s foundation.  In 2004, PACE added the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award, which specifically recognizes the contributions of persons under the age of 25. Many winners of the “Young Cooper” award are high school or college students at the time they are recognized. This year, PACE would like to recognize the following individuals for their work on expanding and improving high school quizbowl at the local and national levels.   The Academic Ambassador Award will be presented to Chad Kubicek in recognition of his work as tournament-hosting contact for NAQT, promoting the spread of quiz bowl across the country. The Young Ambassador Award will be presented to Kady Hsu of Rancho Bernardo High School in recognition of her work to organize and expand the tournament circuit in Southern California. These awards will be presented at the opening meeting of the 2018 PACE NSC, on Saturday, June 2 in Reston, VA. Please join me in congratulating both winners and thanking them for their work to improve the quiz bowl community. Congratulations to Chad and Kady! We at PACE thank you for all your hard work building the high school quizbowl circuit.",

    "title": "Game Format Summary",
    "content": "Game Format Summary Tossups: Powers in the PACE-NSC format are worth 20 points. The portion of the tossup that is worth 20 points is in bold. Power ends at the (*) in the written question. A correct answer during the remainder of the tossup is worth 10 points. A player must begin giving an answer within 5 seconds of buzzing in. If no one has answered a tossup correctly within 5 seconds of its completion, the tossup goes dead and the next tossup will be read. There are no point deductions for incorrect interrupts. However, if a team incorrectly interrupts a tossup, that team is locked out of answering that tossup. A score check will be performed after 10 tossups. Teams also have the opportunity to make substitutions at this time (and at this time only). Bonuses:   After a team correctly answers a tossup, that team is awarded a bonus. Bonuses should be read in order; bonus number does not correspond to tossup number. The controlling team should be prompted for an answer to each bonus part after 4 seconds.   If the controlling team answers a bonus part incorrectly, the other team has the opportunity to “steal” the part. This is called a bounceback. Bounceback answers must be prompted for after one second. Bouncebacks occur after each part, not the entire bonus. The controlling team always has the first opportunity to answer each part. See the following page for details on how a bonus will be replaced in the event of protest or moderator error.   If the game is tied after tossup 20: The moderator will read an additional (sudden death) tossup. If someone gives a correct answer to that tossup, the appropriate number of points is added to their team’s score and the game ends. If nobody answers tossup 21, the moderator will get additional tossups from the control room to be read in sudden­death fashion until one team answers a tossup correctly.",

    "content": "Welcome to the 21st Annual PACE National Scholastic Championship and the 4th Annual David Riley Coaches Conference! It is a pleasure and an honor to host such a great collection of teams from all over the country and to some extent all over the world. Whether this is your school’s first time participating or it has been here many times before, we are happy to have you. There are so many different people who are essential to make a tournament like this happen and make an organization like PACE work, and I am grateful for their many contributions. Michael Bentley and Fred Morlan deserve high praise for improving PACE many times over the years, especially recently. Tournament Director Ryan Rosenberg, Set Editor Rob Carson, and Event Manager Bernadette Spencer merit special mention for making this year’s tournament work. Many people deserve credit for PACE and the NSC being able to serve high school teams well. In the interest of making quizbowl better and more welcoming, PACE has worked with other major quizbowl organizations to implement a Misconduct Reporting Form. If anybody at NSC says or does something inappropriate that you want us to know about it, feel free to access the form at http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=21339. We will also have links to the form on our website, www.pace-nsc.org. The David Riley Coaches Conference takes place Friday night. We hope you will join us for a wide-ranging discussion of quizbowl. We will talk both about how you can compete better and about how we together can make quizbowl better. Speaking of how we together can make quizbowl better, PACE is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit which sponsors a variety of programs throughout the year in order to advance our mission of promoting high-quality high school quizbowl. I’d like to highlight two such programs in particular: The PACE Outreach Fund This is a grant that individuals and quizbowl organizations can apply for to help recruit new teams to a circuit or to start a circuit. The Morgan Costa-Rhodes Memorial Scholarship This is a scholarship to help students who are starting college who demonstrate dedication to quizbowl, community service, and financial need. More details on each of these programs can be found at our website, www.pace-nsc.org. Our website also contains Quizbowl 101, which is a video and collection of articles about quizbowl. You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube. If you are a graduating senior passionate about high school quizbowl or know someone who is, please let us know. We will be making an open call for new members within the next couple of weeks. You can also email me personally at president@pace-nsc.org. Once again, thank you so much for attending this year’s NSC. I hope you all have a great tournament. Sincerely, David Reinstein President, PACE",

They were runner-up at the Plymouth Regional Inaugural Academic Tournament (to AMSA). They were the small school champion at the Vermont NAQT Championship and at the Plymouth event, and they made the championship bracket at HFT in November. Plymouth also won the New Hampshire History Bowl Championship, finished second to Lexington at the New England History Bowl Championships, and finished 3rd in the small school division at History Bowl Nationals. New Jersey High Tech A Coach: Raymond Eng Roster: Douglas Simons (Senior, headed to New York University) Michael Li (Junior) Steven Liu (Junior) Darren Petrosino (Junior) Team Notes High Tech A has had a great season this year, one of their best so far. The team won several local tournaments, including Scarlet Knight Winter, Livingston March Madness, and Prison Bowl, as well as the NAQT New Jersey State Championships. The team hopes this year’s NSC to be a successful culmination to this season and hopes to best their 23rd place finish last year. High Tech B Coach: Raymond Eng Roster: Adrian Thamburaj (Junior) Cole Snedeker (Junior) Ivy Wang (Junior) Eric Zheng (Junior) Team Notes High Tech B Team competed in events such as Princeton’s PHSAT, the Columbia Cup series, LIFT, and various other tournaments, and qualified for the NSC at Rutgers Scarlet Knights Winter with a 4th place finish. The year’s high point was at East Brunswick’s Funfest tournament where an undefeated High Tech B Team was matched against an undefeated High Tech A Team in the final Championship match. High Tech C Coach: Raymond Eng Roster: Frank Grabowski (Sophomore) Selena Liu (Sophomore) Deepak Gopalakrishnan (Freshman) Alex Wu (Freshman) Team Notes High Tech’s C team is excited to attend PACE 2018. In September, the team won the Standard Division at Princeton’s 25th High School Academic Tournament. In February, competing against varsity teams the C team won Bard High School Early College’s inaugural quiz bowl tournament. In March, the team won the JV Mid-Atlantic National History Bowl Regional Championship at Princeton University and in April, placed 18th at the 2018 JV National History Bowl in Washington, D.C. Nevada Ed W Clark High School Coach: Manu Vakil Roster: Eshaan Vakil (Sophomore) Sierra Vista High School Coach: David Jurvelin, player 7 Emma Jurvelin (10th grade) Roster: Rachel Vallin (Senior) Eric Chio (Senior, headed to University of Nevada, Reno) Taylor Graham (Senior, headed to University of Nevada, Reno) Dylan Viloria (Senior, headed to University of Nevada, Reno) Alex Tang (Senior, headed to University of Nevada, Reno) Sarah Gu (Senior, headed to University of Nevada, Reno) Team Notes Las Vegas Quiz Bowl Association Regular Season runners up in 1st full year of competition New York Bard High School Early College Manhattan A Coach: Randal Despommier Roster: Maximilian Shatan (Senior, headed to Wesleyan University) Lev Bernstein (Senior, headed to New York University) Maya Rubin (Senior, headed to Wellesley) Cade Aguda (Senior, headed to Northwestern University in Qatar) Team Notes Playing since only February 2017 (anno domini), Bard (not “Brad”) has established itself as a pretty rad team that does quizbowl things. With a superclassic lineup of Maximilian Shatan (the cool one), Lev Bernstein (the fun one), Christopher Stauffer (the tall one), and Cade Aguda (the nice one), Bard has made a name for itself by doing pretty darn well, and not much else except for internet stuff but this is real life Morpheus you trickster you. Our main goals at PACE-NSC are as follows: tricking another team into incorrectly answering a bounceback using tinfoil alone, powering a tossup by going back in time and writing the tossup ourselves in Superspacetime ink, and making new friends (this one is honest.) We love playing and sometimes winning, and we can’t wait to compete at PACE. Shoutout to Dr. Despommier for being a cool and rad advisor. Hunter A Coach: Caitlin Samuel Roster: Chloe Levine (Senior, headed to Harvard) Samuel Brochin (Senior, headed to University of Pittsburgh) Gilad Avrahami (Senior, headed to Haverford) Brian Lu (Junior) Team Notes Hunter A is a rather amorphous team which has been described by numerous rosters throughout the year, but right now, we are Chloe Levine (Captain and President), Sam Brochin (Senior Advisor), Gilad Avrahami (Middle School Director), and Brian Lu (Treasurer). Yeah, that’s right: We’ve all got named positions. Join Hunter QB because we got you for college apps. Anyway, we’re stoked to be back at PACE. It’s Chloe’s favorite tournament. (Also, it’s Sam’s least favorite tournament, but we’ll ignore that part.) Chloe, Sam, and Gilad were three members of a five-person B Team at PACE 2015 which dubbed itself the Freshman Five and has been not just a group of friends throughout high school but also an invaluable support network, and we’re glad to be back where at least two of us feel our personal connection to Quiz Bowl began. Chloe is really hoping to power another question on The Stone Breakers this year, because that would provide some nice closure. In conclusion, this certainly isn’t the team we thought we’d be bringing, but we’re really glad it ended up this way, and we can’t wait to finish off the season alongside our friends and our amazing advisor, Ms. Samuel. Thanks for answering our late night texts about misogyny, Ms. S. Go Hawks! Hunter B Coach: Caitlin Samuel Roster: David Godovich (Senior, headed to SUNY Binghamton) Asher Jaffe (Sophomore) Rachel Yang (Freshman) Cerulean Ozarow (Freshman) Ella Leeds (Freshman) Team Notes Hunter B is a lean, mean powerin’ machine. We hope you’re ready for ‘em. We’ve got not one but two mythology specialists (the formidable David Godovich, who is Team Captain, and the smaller but still formidable Rachel Yang), an NAQT-lover ready to prove he won’t be fooled by PACE’s long sentences (Cerulean Ozarow), an animal sciences specialist and member of the high-ranking Hunter JV History Bowl Team (Ella Leeds), and a…. Well, we’re not sure what to call Asher Jaffe, but with his stats and his very exciting hair, we’re pretty sure he’s going to beat you to the buzzer at least once. With the exception of David, all of the team’s players are sophomores or freshmen, so they’ve got a bright, bright future ahead. But that doesn’t mean they’re not going to seize the opportunity for brightness now! Look out, friends and foes alike! Hide your stat lines! Here they come! Island Trees High School Coach: Ludgero Medeiros Roster: David Wendt (Junior) Jonathan Garcia (Senior, headed to Stony Brook University) Thomas Zamroz (Junior) Kenneth Chan (Senior, headed to Boston University) Joshua Kim (Junior) Team Notes The Island Trees Academic Team worked hard in the 2017-2018 school year to kick it up a notch and take on some of the toughest teams in the New York area. With that aim in mind, Island Trees has had a successful season, placing third in the inaugural Bard Bowl and finishing fourth as the smallest school among the finalists in the Long Island Regional Quiz Bowl. Led by Junior captain David Wendt, the Island Trees squad played in all three legs of the Columbia Cup, and finished strongly in the Long Island Fall Tournament hosted by Kellenberg High School. With a strong crop of players coming back for senior year, Island Trees will be a force to reckon with in the 2018-2019 academic year. Ithaca High School Coach: Benjamin Kirk Roster: Isaiah Gutman (Junior) Kaelan Imani (Sophomore) Vaynu Kadiyali (Junior) Julian Perry (Junior) Team Notes This team of juniors and sophomores had big shoes to fill after last year’s Ithaca A team, but they’ve done an awesome job getting there, continuing Ithaca’s reputation of being the dominant team in Upstate New York. We’re leading the way in growing Quizbowl regionally, hosting two tournaments during the year and participating in others locally, but we’re not afraid to hop a bus and head downstate or to Pennsylvania or New Jersey, never coming back without at least a top bracket placement! The team has been working hard and are excited to see how they do at this year’s PACE NSC! Ohio Beavercreek Coach: Ellen Spence, Juli Cohen, Lakshmy Parameswaran Roster: Hari Parameswaran (Junior) David Cohen (Senior, headed to Ohio State University) Ziyi Zuo (Senior, headed to Carnegie Mellon University) Abby Cohen (Freshman) Team Notes This will be Beavercreek’s second time competing at the NSC. Three players return from last year: Hari Parameswaran (Junior), David Cohen (Senior), and Ziyi Zuo (Senior). Along with our fourth player, Abby Cohen (Freshman), we hope to improve upon our last year’s 18th place finish. David will be attending Ohio State University, and Ziyi, Carnegie Mellon University; they are both pursuing engineering. Our coaches include Ellen Spence, Juli Cohen, and Lakshmy Parameswaran. Copley A Coach: Joshua Eck, Sue Korosa, Melissa Lopez Roster: Tommy Varley (Senior, headed to Case Western Reserve) Srikar Dudipala (Senior, headed to Brown) Frank Mularcik (Sophomore) Nathan Hazlett (Freshman) Team Notes The team has won 9 tournaments and 128 matches, which are both fourth best in school history. The team finished fifth at states and appeared on the TV show Academic Challenge where they scored the most points in the past ten years. Dublin Scioto High School Coach: Roster: Team Notes Dublin Scioto High School declined to submit a roster. Miami Valley Coach: Roster: John John Groger (Sophomore) William Groger (Freshman) Northmont High School Coach: David Jones Roster: Samantha Street (Freshman) Sean Scranton (Freshman) Zach Weeks (Freshman) Amara Nwanoro (Freshman) William Miller (Junior) Athena Dobles (Sophomore) Team Notes In what was supposed to be a rebuilding year, the Northmont Academic Challenge team won their 10th consecutive league championship, won 4 tournaments, and captured the Ohio History Bowl state championship. This year’s team consists of four freshmen and one junior after graduating our entire team last year. The team has competed in 12 states this year, winning events in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. Solon High School Coach: Peter Bergman Roster: Timmy Huang (Junior) Sam Oguntoyinbo (Junior) Neel Mehta (Junior) Pranit Behara (Junior) Team Notes Competing in the tough Ohio circuit, Solon compiled a record of 115-29 over 17 tournaments in 2017-2018, earning four 1st place and six 2nd place finishes. These four 11th graders are all competing in their first NSC. Oklahoma Norman High School Coach: David Powell Roster: Jake Perry (Senior, headed to Trinity University) Brian Thompson (Senior, headed to The University of Oklahoma) Luke Fronheiser (Junior) Theo Cohen (Junior) Shengran Zhou (Sophomore) Team Notes This year we have had a lot of fun (probably too much fun). We placed fourth in our State-run OSSAA tournament for the second year in a row. We competed in many NAQT tournaments and placed in the top 5 at all of them. We look forward to having here at PACE NSC and exploring our nation’s capitol! Pennsylvania Delaware Valley Coach: Kevin DeVizia Roster: Collin Kawan-Hemler (Senior, headed to Haverford College) Frani King (Senior, headed to Brigham Young University) Andy Greene (Senior, headed to Wake Forest University) Abhay Byadgi (Senior, headed to University of Pittsburgh) Emma Dove (Junior) Chris Secular (Junior) Darius Bermudez (Sophomore) Team Notes The Delaware Valley Scholastic Bowl team, over the course of the current season, has featured 26 different players in grades 8-12 in 13 different tournaments before this year’s PACE-NSC. Highlights of this season have included championships at Big Lake Brawl II, at the Intermediate IU 20 Competition covering a four-county region of NE Pennsylvania and eventually being a semifinalist at the State Championships, winning our local league’s Rotary-sponsored tournament for the Tri-State area of PA/NY/NJ, and winning the WVIA-TV Scholastic Scrimmage Championship and its grand prize of $5000. Downingtown STEM Coach: Priya Shanmugam Roster: Vishwa Shanmugam (Senior, headed to University of Maryland College Park) Rohan Vora (Senior, headed to NYU Stern) Anish Gadgil (Junior) Max Lind (Freshman) Team Notes Downingtown STEM is a strange team. Joining the pyramidal scene in the beginning of 2017, they quickly became a strong contender and grew their clout within the community. They are led by generalist Vishwa, who is known for handing out Black Forest Organic™ gummy bears to anyone who asks and putting up impressive neg numbers. Their history specialist, Anish, is renowned for his hot takes and incessant whining, while arts specialist Rohan is a notable buzzer rock and overall snake. They are joined by rookie lit specialist Max, who, as a freshman, has already proven himself at multiple tournaments. STEM’s pyramidal journey has had its ups and downs, hard-earned wins and crushing defeats, first-place finishes and finals blowouts, but, most importantly, they’re glad to have met the awesome people and made the great friends that they did. (Hi Max!) Great Valley Coach: Bern McCauley Roster: Daniel Chen (Senior, headed to University of California, Berkeley) Chris Meehan (Senior, headed to Northeastern) Mark Neri (Senior, headed to RPI) Sam Scarfone (Senior, headed to Minerva) Lehigh Valley Academy Coach: Peter Schmidt Roster: Alex Schmidt (Senior) Team Notes Alex Schmidt is the sole varsity player from Lehigh Valley Academy. (When the rules permit, he plays with little brother, Nathaniel.) Earlier this year, Alex won the National History Bee and US Geography Bee titles. He also holds the record for most points scored in a single NAQT game (IS set or harder) and most points per-game throughout an entire tournament. He will wrap up his high school career later this month when he buzzes in for his fourth Pennsylvania NASAT squad. Manheim Township A Coach: Missy Doll, Ben Osterhout, Tammy Sweeney Roster: Michael Buffa (Senior, headed to Tulane) Bryce Katch (Senior, headed to Penn State) Dan Nguyen (Senior, headed to Penn State) Will Steger (Sophomore) Manheim Township B Coach: Missy Doll, Ben Osterhout, Tammy Sweeney Roster: Eric Anderson (Sophomore) Cyril Hainthaler (Sophomore) Nate Rybner (Junior) Zac Stapler (Junior) Sam Whitton (Junior) Noah Andrews (Junior) South Carolina Dorman High School Coach: Cyrenna Moreno, Brian Owen, Ellen Ames Roster: Chandler Parks (Senior, headed to University of South Carolina) William Richey (Senior, headed to University of South Carolina) Kyle Quinn (Junior) Delario Nance (Sophomore) Charlie Weaver (Sophomore) Tennessee Battle Ground Academy Coach: Mark Lewis Roster: Jack Lewis (Senior, headed to University of Maryland College Park) Cameron Clark (Senior, headed to University of Central Florida) Texas Gregory-Portland High School Quiz Bowl Team Coach: Kristin McLaughlin Roster: Dmitriy Stegall (Senior, headed to University of Texas) Nathan Kastl (Senior, headed to Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi) J’Von Ortiz Cedeno (Senior, headed to Bates College) Ben Horton (Senior, headed to Texas A&amp;M University) Alex Zuniga Garcia (Senior, headed to Texas A&amp;M University Corpus Christi)Trevor Griffin (Senior) James E.

Strake Jesuit A Coach: Mr. Kyle Gibson, Dr. Max Maier, Dr. Christopher Romero Roster: John Luke Broussard (Junior) Joshua Hew (Junior) Sean Doyle (Junior) Houston Mark (Sophomore) Eli Blasini (Freshman) Strake Jesuit B Coach: Mr. Kyle Gibson, Dr. Max Maier, Dr. Christopher Romero Roster: Robert Condron (Sophomore) Pablo Lloyd (Sophomore) Michael Artlip (Sophomore) Isean Bhalla (Freshman) Virginia Langley A Coach: Kevin Healy Roster: Craig Anderson (Senior, headed to JMU) Surya Ambardar (Senior, headed to UVA) Dan Ni (Junior) Matthew Rubin (Junior) Selena Bao (Sophomore) Langley B Coach: Eliza Steele Roster: Alec Dempsey (Sophomore) Ari Tretiak (Sophomore) Daniel Mousavi (Sophomore) Jeffrey Grow (Sophomore) Nima Razavi (Sophomore) Maggie Walker Governor’s School Coach: Hana Voight, Juanita Lasswell Roster: Catherine Qian (Senior, headed to University of Pennsylvania) Anuj Kotak (Senior, headed to Virginia Commonwealth University) Kelin Carpenter (Senior, headed to Wofford College) Owen Peck (Senior, headed to College of William and Mary) Daniel Xue (Sophomore) New Horizons Governor School Coach: Rhett Woo Roster: Jakob Weiss (Senior, headed to Boston College) Kate Perkins (Senior, headed to Harvey Mudd) Rachel McNamara (Senior, headed to UVA) James Harrington (Senior, headed to University of Alabama) Lewis McAllister (Senior, headed to Harvard) Jenny Gu (Senior, headed to Harvard) Team Notes The New Horizons Governor’s School for Science and Technology team of Jenny Gu, James Harrington, Lewis McAllister, Rachel McNamara, Kate Perkins, and Jakob Weiss, was just formed this year. The first quiz bowl NHGS attended was the MVGS Open at the Mountain Vista Governor’s School. The team took a lot of lessons from that competition, for many it was the first quiz bowl they had attended in that format. A few weeks later, New Horizons competed in William &amp; Mary’s second annual James Blair bowl. The senior team won second place at that event, with 3 members earning honors as top 10 scorers. It has been an honor to compete this year as the team heads off to BC, Harvard, Harvey Mudd, U of Alabama and UVA. The team would especially like to thank their coach Dr. Woo for making this all possible. James W. Robinson Secondary School Coach: Michael P. Campana, Chris W.
