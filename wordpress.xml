  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Hi. We're ACF.</h3>
We produce three high-quality collegiate quizbowl tournaments each year. Our organization is completely student and volunteer-run, by quizbowl players, for quizbowl players. Our tournaments are written to reward academic knowledge, encourage learning, and foster the spirit of competition and fair play.
<h3>Want to play ACF tournaments?</h3>
ACF tournaments for the 2019-2020 season will be announced in summer 2019.

If you are interested in hosting, please read through the official <a style="color:#999999;" title="Hosting Guidelines" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/hosting-guidelines/">ACF Hosting Guide</a> and then email Evan Adams at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:adamsej2@vcu.edu">adamsej2@vcu.edu</a>.</span>

Please take a moment to review the guidelines and format your packet accordingly.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. Please also refer to this thread excoriating those who attempted to plagiarize at ACF Fall 2008. This happened a lot in <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6868">2008</a>, and if it happens again the consequences will be enforced.</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please see the <a style="color:#999999;" title="Question Writing Guidelines" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">additional packet penalties section</a> for more info.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets, or talk about their contents.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><!-- m -->The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2010 is the same as that of the last two years, so teams are encouraged to follow the difficulty levels of ACF Fall 2008 and ACF Fall 2009. Those tournaments can be found here: <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><!-- m -->Remember above all that this tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please contact Evan Adams at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:adamsej2@vcu.edu">adamsej2@vcu.edu</a></span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>So what’s ACF all about then?</strong></h2>
Academic Competition Federation (ACF) is a non-incorporated, non-profit organization dedicated to providing high-quality quiz tournaments. We are entirely student and volunteer run. We pride ourselves on the highest standard of academic question writing and we keep the amount of pop culture (a.k.a. trash) or semi-academic questions to a minimum.

We offer three tournaments throughout the academic year:
<ul>
	<li>ACF Fall is an introductory-level event that is held in early November.</li>
	<li>ACF Regionals is a “regular difficult” event that is held in January/February.  It serves as a qualifier for ACF Nationals.</li>
	<li>ACF Nationals is the premier collegiate championship event. It is held in April. To participate in ACF Nationals, teams must qualify through their performance at ACF Regionals, or may apply for wildcard bids.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Sounds great! Who can play in ACF tournaments?</strong></h2>
You and your teammates must be:
<ul>
	<li>all attending the same school, and</li>
	<li>all taking at least one class for credit during the school year.</li>
</ul>
If you are not sure whether you are eligible, you may write to <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/2018-2019-officers/">ACF’s eligibility committee</a>

“Mixed” teams (or “Masters” teams or “Chimera” teams), i.e. teams containing players not all from one school, or players who have graduated are not allowed to play. The head editor of the tournament may make an exception; however, these dispensations are made very limited circumstances. ACF reserves the right to disallow any team from playing at one of its tournaments.
<h2><strong>How can I become an ACF Member?</strong></h2>
We are always on the lookout for new editors. If you are interested in joining ACF, contact any one of the current ACF editors. You should be ready to show samples of your question-writing and/or editing work.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</strong></h2>
If you have any questions regarding this guide, please contact <a href="mailto:grapesmoker@gmail.com?Subject=ACF Question Writing Guidelines">Jerry</a>.

Now that the discussion of the various tournaments has finally petered out, I thought I'd promulgate some dogma on question writing, seeing as how I'm always yelling really loudly about question quality and such. I encourage other players to contribute, and I'll incorporate good suggestions into the original post. Before I get going, I'd like to point out that many of the things I'll be writing about are settled issues with respect to question writing, but many others reflect my own stylistic preferences, and I'll be sure to try and point out which are my own biases. To begin:

<strong>1. Before Writing Questions</strong>

Look around you. Look around you. Just look around you. Do you see what we're looking for yet? That's right, the subject of today's lesson is sources.

I'd like to start this guide with a general discussion of what makes a good question-writing source. There are many things that one can use, but obviously not all sources are equally reliable. Notably unreliable sources include Wikipedia and random geocities web pages. Reliable sources include scholarly journals, textbooks, published books, and encyclopedias of various sorts. If you can get your hands on it, the electronic version of the Encyclopedia Britannica is superb for many topics, particularly history. Masterplots are a good resource for literature plot summaries, and there are many topic-specific encyclopedias that are surely available at your local university (or public) library (I'm assuming that virtually all of you have some sort of university affiliation).

Wikipedia may be worthy of a special topic of its own; I mention it here to point out that while it may be a nice source for brainstorming before you actually start writing, you should be thrice-wary of anything you read on Wikipedia. I don't want to get into a discussion of the problems that inhere in the Wikipedia model. Suffice to say that it is not a trustworthy source, though it does in fact contain much that is true. Anything read on Wikipedia should be cross-checked with a more reliable scholarly source. For that matter, pretty much anything you read on the internets that doesn't come from a journal should be double-checked. There are some sites which are pretty reliable and contain some useful information; those are usually associated with universities in some way. The worst part of using Wikipedia as a source is the noted problem of Wikiplagiarism, which is what occurs when people just copy sentences out of Wikipedia. Wikiplagiarism can be easily spotted by competent editors because it contains weird phrasings that usually shouldn't appear in questions, as well as editorializing. I'll have more on style topics below.

Another useful source is online lecture notes (thanks Dwight), whether they come from a class you're taking or just from some stuff professors at other institutions put up. These are generally reliable (they have been in my experience) and ordinarily are pretty easy to get, since many professors just make their notes available to whoever. A notably good source for such notes is MIT's Open CourseWare site, which contains a lot of excellent information on various scientific topics (and some others too).

All this makes it sound like sources are hard to get to and require a lot of work. For the most part, you should be able to get a lot of mileage out of a few books available from whatever library is easiest for you to get to.

<strong>2. Deciding What to Write About</strong>

This is arguably the hardest phase of the whole process; I know for me it's usually the stumbling block, whereas once I have my topics picked out things generally go pretty smoothly. How can you make a good decision regarding what to write? Read below to find out!

First, you have to know your audience. Are you writing for a novice tournament, a standard invitational, or ACF Nationals? This will determine, to some degree, what answer selections are appropriate in your packet, and later on, what clues you use to construct this question. Second, you should ask yourself whether the answer you are thinking about will make for a good question; although most answers are fine, all other things being equal, some answers don't lend themselves well to good questions and should be avoided if possible. I'll try to outline some of that below. Finally, you should ask yourself whether writing on this particular answer choice is going to require a lot of research. This has less to do with writing a good question and more with budgeting time for doing so. If you find yourself spending an hour per tossup, you're either doing something wrong or picking topics that take far more time to research than they should.

With regard to difficulty, context matters a lot. If you're writing for a tournament like ACF Fall, which is going to include a lot of new players who are, at best, familiar with the high school canon, the goal should be for every tossup to be answered by every team if read to that team to completion against empty chairs. Obviously, this is an ideal; sometimes, people blank on the answer, and sometimes they just don't know it, but at tournaments which are supposed to be introductions to collegiate quizbowl for most participants, the great majority (90%, say) should at least have heard of the answer. So, a tossup on Herbet Spencer would be fine, whereas a tossup on Social Statics is almost certainly too hard.

For harder tournaments, the field of allowable answers is expanded, but it can still be hard to know whether what you're writing is appropriate. I think the following method provides a decent rule of thumb that one can follow: consult past instances of this tournament. If a clue appears multiple times in a tossup, but doesn't appear as a bonus part, it may be all right to make it the hard part of a bonus. If something appears as the hard part multiple times, you could probably promote it to one of the easier parts. If something appears multiple times as a middle or easy part of a bonus, it's probably good tossup material. At first, this might seem like a daunting task, but I think you'll find that if you read packets in practice and go to tournaments, you'll quickly get a handle on what's hard and what's not. At the very worst, by following this method, you will likely err on the side of an easier topic, which is fine. It also makes a difference whether you're writing tossups or bonuses. For example, a European history bonus that included parts on the War of the Spanish Succession, the Treaty of Utrecht, and Philip V would be perfectly reasonable for ACF Fall, but a tossup on Philip V himself would probably be excessive. On the other hand, Philip V might be acceptable as a tossup at ACF Nationals.

I'd also like to address a particular misconception that has formed around some tournaments like ACF Nationals and Regionals. It appears that these tournaments are erroneously viewed by some teams as the perfect opportunities to drag out that tossup on minor works of Selma Lagerloff. Please resist the temptation to do this; before writing, you should really do what I suggest above and check to make sure that whatever it is you're going to write about has a decent chance of being answered. Depending on the results of the above procedure, you might do better by making this subject a bonus part or a clue to something more gettable. Many times, an inexperienced player will hear something that he thinks is tossup-worthy in class and rush to write about it, only to stump an entire tournament. Also, it's generally a good idea to avoid things that are too highly specialized. Some specialist material, especially in science questions, is inevitable, but even within the category, no one should have to have a Ph.D. in the subject to answer the question.

Mostly, I've been writing about tossups. As far as bonuses are concerned, a good way of constructing a bonus is the "easy-middle-hard" model which is now pretty much predominant in quality tournaments. The easy part of the bonus should be answerable by pretty much any team at the tournament. The middle part might be answerable by about half the teams, whereas one might need to have really good knowledge to get the third part; probably no more than 20% of teams should reasonably be able to 30 a bonus. Of course, bonuses vary in difficulty for different teams, but in general, a tournament with well-distributed bonus difficulty will have bottom teams converting not much less than (preferrably around) 10 PPB, whereas the best teams could conceivably top 20 PPB, and bonus conversion should be well-correlated with overall place in the tournament.

This brings me to the somewhat peripheral but still important issue of consistency. This is less important for tossups, which contain internal difficulty gradations, than it is for bonuses. If all the science bonuses at a tournament are super hard, you're going to screw some teams really badly. For this reason, following the above bonus writing model is a good way to ensure that you aren't making any one category too hard. Some teams are going to just not know some areas, and that's fine, but if some bonuses are consistently harder than others, that has the potential to really damage teams. In accordance with this principle, the practice of the impossible third bonus part should also be avoided. The possibility of getting 30 points on a bonus should always be there for the talented team; overly difficult bonus parts effectively turn 30 potential points into only 20, which tends to really narrow the gap between teams.

Ok, this is the part where I address some objections to my own advice. There are some people who adhere to the view that one should write about things people are likely to know about instead of things that have come up before. Matt Weiner is one notable proponent of this view. I'd like to note that I don't completely disagree with this, but I am of the opinion that things that have come up in packets before are things that people are likely to know. One might make the argument that this rewards people who read or hear lots of packets, and this is of course true. But I contend that these people will be rewarded anyway, because if you write about what people know, and people play on those packets, the people who played on them will have the same advantage when the same topic comes up, regardless of the reason for why it comes up in quizbowl.

For more information on canon expansion, please refer to Andrew Hart's excellent guidelines on the subject.

<strong>3. Actually Writing the Questions</strong>

Ok, with that long preamble out of the way, we can get down to the business of actually writing some questions. I'll try to provide some guidelines for general question writing and also dissect some questions to demonstrate what makes for good and bad tossups and bonuses. Here we go!

<em>3.1. Tossups</em>

The first principle of good tossup writing is pyramidality. What is pyramidality, you ask? Pyramidality is simply the principle of putting harder clues earlier in the questions, with the idea being that the more knowledgable team will answer the tossup first because they know more about the subject. I like to think of the pyramid as representing the proportion of teams that would know the answer to the tossup at some particular spot in the question. So the apex of the pyramid represents a specialist in the subject, and the base represents most people who play quizbowl and have heard of the answer. Ideally, there should be a relatively smooth gradation between the apex and the base, although of course real tossups resemble ziggurats (or perhaps mastabas) more than actual pyramids. Nevertheless, the idea is clear: there are gradations of clue difficulty in tossups which is intended to distinguish between more knowledgable and less knowledgable players.

There's no magic formula for writing tossups, unfortunately. If there were, we could have computer write tossups for us and the problem of generating questions would be solved once and for all. While Ray Luo labors to come up with such a machine, I'll just go ahead and describe, in general terms, what the various levels of the tossup pyramid might look like and what kind of clues they might contain. Keep in mind that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but I hope it will prove instructive.

The first clue of a question should contain information that is unlikely to be known by anyone who has not spent at least some time studying whatever the answer might be. When I say "studying" I don't necessarily mean studying in school, but rather this word should be read as meaning "absorbing information about," and I write "studying" for short. So, reading a book by or about, say, Herman Melville, qualifies as studying in this sense. If I were determined to learn a lot about Moby Dick I would certainly read the work itself, but I might also read various critical interpretations of it. That kind of clue would be pretty useful to me then; it would give me an advantage over someone who has just read the book but not the criticism. In science, such a clue might reference a little-known application of some effect, for instance. In history, it could be a clue about an academic historian's interpretation of some event. And so on.

I think this is a good point to insert a brief caveat about such first clues. It can be hard sometimes, especially when employing clues of the type "Joe Blow said this-and-that about this work," to decide if a clue will actually be useful to anyone. I address this below in the section entitled "The Usefulness of Clues." Moving on:

The next couple of clues (what I'm going to refer to as "the middle") should successively narrow the answer space down to the actual correct answer of the tossup. This is the part that is usually the hardest to execute, since clues that are really easy or really hard might be obviously so, but the arrangement of middle clues is tough because you're trying to create a relatively fine gradation from the start to the end of the tossup. It's hard to say exactly what those clues should be, but maybe some examples would be instructive. If the question is on a work of literature, (say, the very same Moby Dick), you might describe a somewhat-little-known episode in the book, followed by the actions of some better-known characters, followed by some even better-known names or events. In a science tossup, you might talk about a lesser-known consequence of some effect, then maybe the equation that describes this effect, followed by a better-known consequence. Or something like that.

The key component of clue ordering is to ask yourself, what would a person who knows a lot/a decent amount/not so much/very little (pick one) be likely to know about whatever it is that you're writing about. This requires some intuition in some cases, because unless you've been around the circuit for a while, you probably don't know that certain clues for certain things are considered "stock" and thus shouldn't be anywhere but in the end of a tossup. However, for many situations, you can figure this out; in literature, for example, it should be straightforward to see which characters are minor and which are major, which events are central to the work and which are just vignettes. If you're writing on some idea or theory, the name of its formulator probably belongs in the end, unless it's obscure. Likewise for common definitions (like in a math question), or major scenes in novels, or most famous lines of poetry, or whatever. You should quickly get some sense for what the clue ordering might be like by reading a bunch of tossups; that's not to say that you have to slavishly emulate what came before you (maybe you found a neat new clue or something) but it does mean that if you follow the conventional clue order you will probably write a decent tossup.

The giveaway is self-explanatory. It should contain the most famous bit of information about whatever the answer is. It should usually not, in my opinion, contain tangential clues (the James Webb telescope comes to mind) about what the answer sounds like or anything that requires lateral thinking. Note the emphasis on "usually." Sometimes an oblique reference to another thing that may help someone get the question is fine (mostly I'm thinking of common-link tossups), but most of the time it's not.

<em>3.2. Bonuses</em>

There's a lot less to say about writing bonuses than about writing tossups, mostly because the confusion associated with pyramidality is to some extent absent in bonuses. Bonuses should generally follow the "easy-medium-hard" model of bonus parts and the majority of the bonuses you write should be of the 10-10-10 variety. We can loosely define "easy" to mean that we would like 90% of the field to convert this part, "medium" to mean that maybe 40-50% of the field will convert it, and "hard" to mean that perhaps 10-20% of the field should convert it. These are not hard-and-fast numbers; they are just vague signposts to explain what is meant by the difficulty levels. Obviously, these may be adjusted downward or upward for various tournaments, but I think they are generally a good indication of how to break down bonus parts by difficulty.

In writing bonuses, avoid the "impossible third part." A sufficiently comptetent team may not get 30 points on each bonus, but the potential for 30 points should be there. A bonus part on something that no one who is not an expert on some particular subcategory wouldn't even have heard of is a bad idea. It is also bad to have the bonus difficulty differ substantially across categories within a tournament (and especially within a single packet). Such bonuses tend to screw an unfortunate team and can make the difference in close games. Of course, there will be variability between teams, and some categories will be known better than others, but the potential for the structure of the packet (rather than the clue content) to influence the outcome of the game should be minimized.

<em>3.3. Style</em>

This may be the most subjective section of all, but I think it's necessary to say something about the stylistic issues inherent in question writing. It should go without saying that packets should be grammatically correct, but they're often not, so please read your questions out loud to yourself to make sure the sentence structure makes sense. We all make mistakes of course, but some tournaments I've been to have featured missing words or spelling errors or grammatical mistakes in almost every question. This is the minimum that can be expected of any writer. I'll say it again: PROOFREAD!

The first clue of a tossup should always be uniquely identifying (to the best of the writer's abilities; sometimes information may match two answers despite the writer's best attempts). Also, the first pronoun should refer unambiguously to the answer and should appear IN THE FIRST SENTENCE. I can't stress this enough! If the first sentence of a tossup finishes and I don't know what category the answer goes in (person, place, or thing) then this question is bad because it doesn't make clear what it's looking for.

More generally, there are different ways to word questions, and different approaches to writing. On one level, you may choose between simple, declaratory sentences (e.g. "This guy wrote about Joe Blow in Work X. Then he wrote about Jane Doe in Work Y.") or compound sentences with clauses and subclauses (e.g. "This guy wrote about Joe Blow in Work X, after which he used his experience in the Pastry War to write about Jane Doe in Work Y."). You get the idea, I'm sure. I personally like the latter style, but some people like the former. I don't think there's anything wrong with either one, provided you are economical about your word choice. Since questions are typically limited in length by editors, you should make sure that all the words you use are meaningful. If a clue can be rewritten with shorter words in place of longer ones, you should probably do that. This saves space and helps you pack more information into a tossup.

Within clues, there are different ways of ordering information. For example, notice how above I used the form "wrote about Joe Blow in Work X," rather than, "His Work X concerns the adventures of Joe Blow." This is deliberate; any random quizbowl player is less likely to know the main character of any given novel than the name of the novel itself. And so on. I recommend using this construction to create pyramidality within clues themselves.

Finally, a word on gender. For a long time, there has been what I think is a nasty trope in quizbowl, which involves writing things like "this writer," or "this scientist," or whatever in an attempt to disguise the fact that the person in question is female. This is annoying, because instead of saying "she," which is shorter, you're now using up more space and you're not even hiding the fact that it's a woman, because everyone now knows to watch for this. So my suggestion is that people use "this [blank]" in the first couple of clues, but then just transition to the male or female pronouns. In most cases, the field of women whatevers is not nearly so narrow as to shrink the potential answer space down to something obvious.

<em>3.4. The Usefulness of Clues</em>

This is another problem that I see come up over and over again. Clues get used in tossups that are just not useful to anyone. Egregious examples of these kinds of clues are "Joe Blow notably studied this thing." These clues are unhelpful because unless you know exactly who Joe Blow is (and even then, he might have notably studied several things), you can't possibly get anything out of this. Such a clue could be converted into a useful one by writing, "Joe Blow notably addressed this issue in his tract 'On Stuff'," provided that "On Stuff" is actually about only that one thing. Clues containing numbers in science questions (e.g. "Its albedo is a million," "This quantity is 234.9 for water," etc.) are also useless, because no one memorizes these numbers. Vague clues like "In this novel one character goes to the store for some lettuce," are also not useful since they are probably not uniquely identifying. Clues like "This river is 543 miles long" are also dumb because no one, not even geography wizard Jeff Hoppes, knows these things. In short, if you are tempted to pad a question with the kind of information found in an almanac, don't. Make sure that all your clues convey useful information that someone could actually get the question from.

All this leads me to the culmination of this lengthy opus, which is perhaps the most important part.

<em>3.5 What to Avoid, and Why</em>

I've done my best to cover how questions ought to be written; now I'll point to some mistakes people make in writing questions and explain why you shouldn't do these things.

Tossups
<ul>
	<li>Giveaways in the first line are bad. Since pyramidality is good and this makes the question not pyramidal, it is bad. Ok, that was the obvious one</li>
	<li>Stock clues. These are clues that were abundant in old, pre-2002 or so quizbowl, like Michael Faraday being apprenticed to a bookbinder or Saussure writing about Indo-European languages (must be the most reused lead-in ever). These clues are bad because instead of learning anything about the subject at hand, people just memorize clues which end up being recycled by lazy writers. Sometimes, the recycling of these clues by beginning writers is inevitable, but editors should know better. Keep in mind that not ever lead-in is a "stock" clue, since there are plenty of different ways to write a tossup on, say, Herman Melville, and some of them may recycle clues about his lesser-known works. However, clues that come up again and again (the Saussure clue is bad because it's his only other published work, so it gets referenced all the time, becoming "stock"). My suggestion for avoiding this is to search the Stanford Archive for the topic and then see if the lead-in you want to use appears many times in older packets. If it does, don't use it.</li>
	<li>Question Transparency. This is a huge one, and I didn't really address it above. I'll do so now. The idea of question transparency is that if you write the question poorly (or if you choose your answer poorly), it will become very obvious what the answer is without the player actually having to know anything. Case in point, picked at random from whatever Moon Pie packet I happened to be looking at: a tossup on Grimm's Law, which mentions something about exceptions to it being described by the spirant law and later in the first sentence mentions voiceless dentals. Now, I know nothing, but nothing about voiceless dentals. All I have is a little radar that beeps "linguistics" when I hear that line. Also, I speak English well so I know that laws have exceptions. What is a law of linguistics? Why, Grimm's law is! This is the classic example of a question that rewards lateral thinking and knowing that an answer vaguely matching the characteristics being described exists. Basically, if someone can "figure out" the answer based on the fact that it becomes obvious (for reasons having to do with poorly placed clues, linguistic hints, whatever) within the first two clues or so (as opposed to because they actually know it from information provided), then the question is bad.</li>
	<li>Editorializing and needless verbiage. Everything you write in a tossup should contain information that helps players answer the question. I've seen at least one packet from Moon Pie that contains all sorts of needless editorial content and mountains of words that don't help at all when playing. Any words that don't contain useful clues are just hindrances for the players; moreover, since space is limited, these questions tend to suffer from sharp difficulty drops and create buzzer races. Speaking of which...</li>
	<li>Buzzer races. If you write a question that contains clues on nothing but Melville's poetry and then a giveaway on Moby Dick you have engineered a stupid and pointless buzzer race, because one either has to be a Melville expert to get this question or wait until the end and hope one is fast enough to beat everyone else who will buzz at the same time. This goes contrary to the idea of pyramidality and having clues which get progressively easier. It also fails to discriminate between two teams with potentially different Melville knowledge, neither of which contains Melville experts.</li>
	<li>List tossups. These kinds of questions violate several rules of good question writing, including the one that mandates that the subject of the answer be revealed in the first sentence. This has the added effect that potentially any commonality between the listed things should logically be an acceptable answer. For example, a question that begins "Julius Caesar, John F. Kennedy, William McKinley," with the intended answer being "they were all assasinated" would be terrible anyway, but logically would have the answer "they were all men" be acceptable. This is stupid and wrong, so don't write these questions, as nothing good can come of it. There does not exist a list tossup that cannot be remade into a better question with the same answer just by changing the wording of the question.</li>
</ul>
Bonuses
<ul>
	<li>List bonuses. These are dumb and uninteresting. These bonuses amount to almanac memorization and tell you nothing interesting about the subject at hand. Authors from works, VSEPR shapes, rulers from dates of rule, whatever. All these are equally dull and should be avoided. The presence of such questions is one of the best indicators of lazy question writing.</li>
	<li>Almanac bonuses. These include memorizing Nobel Prize lists, physical constants, and so on. A relative of the list bonus, and bad for all the same reasons.</li>
	<li>Wacky bonus forms. The 5-10-15 is deprecated; so is the 30-20-10, which is better as a tossup anyway. The 5-10-15 is bad because it penalizes the team twice: once for not knowing the hard part, and once again for making the hard part worth more. The 10-10-10 is king; you should follow this bonus convention unless you have a good reason to change the value of some of the parts (such as if you have two answers required for one part and you'd like to make them 5 each).</li>
	<li>Varying bonus difficulty. Already discussed above, but all your bonuses should aim to be roughly the same in difficulty. They won't be of course; some teams will know some categories and not others, and that's ok. But if all teams are doing poorly on a certain category, then your bonus difficulty is unbalanced. Also, randomly difficult bonus parts in supposedly easy tournaments are also bad.</li>
	<li>Calculation bonuses. These are bad for the same reason that the 5-10-15 is bad, only more so. These bonuses tend to doubly punish teams that lack a specialist since they require you not to just be somewhat familiar with a topic but to know the actual formula. They also punish specialists who may just not be very fast when it comes to calculating something, or who can't remember the exact formula.</li>
	<li>Marzipan, a kick in the balls, both or neither. This is a lousy format because it too punishes a team multiple times, especially if it's used in a science context. These bonuses are annoying because they tend to contain trick questions and encourage guessing. While it's logically possible for such a bonus to not be awful, chances are that if you write one, it will be awful. So don't.</li>
</ul>
Ok, this has been long for me to write and for you to read, so I'll wrap it up right here. Some closing comments: contrary to what you may have heard, standards are not "optional" and while there remain debates about specific things in question writing, most of the core issues really are settled in good tournaments. The outstanding debates are like the outstanding debates about evolution: no one with any expertise in the subject disagrees on the core, though they may debate the specific mechanisms. I hate to make it seem like I'm some sort of quizbowl pope speaking ex cathedra, but it's pretty much true. These issues have been hashed out over the years by experienced players and a lot of thought has gone into making quizbowl questions good. If you are a new player, do not ignore these guidelines and attempt to reinvent the wheel. Rather, take note of these rules, read them once, maybe twice, and then read them again when you feel compelled to write a crappy question.

I welcome everyone's comments on this document, including any suggestions for things I might have missed. I will incorporate good ideas into this original post, which will hopefully be stickied for future reference. If it occurs to me to add something, I'll do so (I plan a little addendum on time management in editing in the future). I also plan to do a dissection of good questions and bad questions somewhere down the line in this thread to give people an idea of what distinguishes one from the other. If other experienced players would care to pitch in with their own ideas, I'm sure that working together we can make this quizbowling world a better place.]]></content:encoded>

 	<li style="list-style-type:none;"></li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Art3"></a>Article 3. Membership</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>There shall be three types of members--Full, Provisional, and Emeritus--as delineated in sections 3.2-3.4.</li>
 	<li>A Full member is defined as an individual who has satisfactorily worked on two or more ACF tournaments or projects in at least one of the following ways:
<ol type="a">
 	<li>Satisfactorily editing for an ACF tournament;</li>
 	<li>Serving as an officer of ACF for a competition year; or</li>
 	<li>Satisfactorily providing substantial aid or logistical assistance to an ACF tournament or project (such as serving as an editing advisor, logistical coordinator, Nationals tournament director or assistant director, or other similar capacity). Solely for the purposes of maintaining Full membership, satisfactorily editing an ACF tournament while being responsible for fewer than the equivalent of two tossups and two bonuses per packet falls within this provision. (Criteria amended 06/28/2016)</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>A Provisional member is defined as an individual who has satisfactorily worked on only one ACF tournament or project in at least one of the following ways:
<ol>
 	<li>Satisfactorily editing for an ACF tournament; or</li>
 	<li>Satisfactorily providing substantial aid or logistical assistance to an ACF tournament or project (such as serving as an editing advisor, logistical coordinator, Fall or Regionals tournament director, Nationals tournament director or assistant director, Nationals host liaison, or other similar capacity). (Criteria amended 05/02/2019)</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>A member becomes Emeritus either by declaring themselves as such, or after three competition years have passed in which the member has not met the requirements of Article 3.2(A)-(C). (Text amended 6/28/2016)
<ol>
 	<li>Each competition year, within three weeks after ACF Nationals, Full members who have not satisfactorily met the requirements of Article 3.2(A)-(C) in the past three competition years will be moved to Emeritus membership. If a member believes they have satisfied Article 3.2(C), they may make an affirmative declaration that they have satisfied that provision within three weeks after movement to Emeritus status. Any Full member who objects to such an affirmation may call a vote (within three weeks of the declaration of intent to remain a Full member) in which a simple majority of Full members decides whether Article 3.2(C) has been satisfied.</li>
 	<li>Emeritus members can return to Full status if they complete one of the activities listed in Article 3.2(A)-(C), and announce their intention to regain Full membership. In the case of Article 3.2(C), any Full member who objects may (within three weeks of the declaration of intent to return to Full membership) call a vote in which a simple majority of Full members decides whether the requirement has been satisfied. If the activity is not completed satisfactorily, or progress is insufficient, any Full member may call a simple-majority vote of Full members to revoke Full membership status at a reasonable time.An Emeritus member is defined as an individual who was once a Full member but is no longer active. (Text amended and reference sections fixed, 06/28/2016; text amended again 05/02/2019)</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>All Provisional members must be approved by 2/3 of the Full members, to be held after ACF Nationals each competition year. Any candidate for Full membership must be approved by 2/3 of the Full members to become a Full member. (Amended 5/01/09; amended 06/28/16)</li>
 	<li>The Full members of ACF may vote to remove any member of ACF; such a vote requires a 75% majority to prevail. The member subject to the removal vote is not eligible to vote. (Added by amendment 4/30/09)</li>
 	<li>Provisional ACF members who have not satisfactorily worked on an ACF project as defined in Article 3.2(A)-(C) in three consecutive competition years will revert to non-membership status in ACF. The three-year period does not include the year in which the Provisional member served in the capacity for which they were voted to provisional membership status. In the case of Article 3.2(C), analogous procedures to those listed in Article 3.4(B) apply. (Amended 5/8/2012; amended 06/28/2016)
<ol type="a">
 	<li>The three-year period for current Provisional members of ACF (as of the date of this amendment’s enactment) will begin at the start of the 2010-11 cycle of ACF tournaments. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010)</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>For the purposes of all Article 3 requirements, "satisfactorily" editing a tournament requires editing and/or writing a number of questions equal to at least two tossups and two bonuses per packet of an ACF tournament to the satisfaction of that tournament's head editor. All votes prescribed in other sections of Article 3 are still required. (Added by amendment 10/19/2011)</li>
 	<li>At any ACF meeting or at any time on the ACF forum, the President may call a vote on any member or potential member's past work, either editorial or logistical, that was, for any reason, previously not voted “satisfactory,” and 2/3 of Full members may vote the work satisfactory for purposes of conferring Provisional or Full membership, or both. For the purposes of Article 3.4, the competition year of votes conducted under this section shall be the competition year in which the work was originally done.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Art4"></a>Article 4. Officers and Duties</h3>
<ol>
 	<li> The President shall serve as the presiding head of ACF. The duties of the President shall be to periodically hear reports from the Officers of ACF and to develop, in consultation with all Full and Provisional members of ACF, an agenda for each official ACF meeting. During each official ACF Meeting, it shall be the responsibility of the President to conduct and moderate discussion in an efficient manner. The President shall be responsible for conducting business on the ACF Forum, including but not limited to proposing official votes and determining deadlines for the passage of said votes. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010, text amended 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>The Officers of the Organization shall consist of the President, the Communications Officer, the Webmaster, the Mirror Coordinator, and the Treasurer. The Officers of ACF shall periodically report to the President, and the discharge of their duties shall be subject to the President's supervision. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010; revised 5/8/2012, further revised 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>The terms of these officers shall begin at the conclusion of one year's ACF Nationals and last until the end of the next year's ACF Nationals, excepting the first year in which this amendment is adopted. Any Full member of ACF may nominate a candidate for each of these positions at any meeting. In order for a nominee to be confirmed, a majority of present Full ACF members must vote for the nominee's confirmation at any meeting. A meeting that determines the slate of non-editorial officers for the following year must occur before the conclusion of an ACF Nationals of any given year. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010)</li>
 	<li>The Communications Officer shall be in charge of maintaining an official e-mail address to which queries regarding ACF shall be directed, as well as responding to whatever queries it shall receive. The Communications Officer shall be responsible for enumerating whatever general ACF policies are not applicable to specific ACF Tournaments. The Communications Officer shall promote ACF Tournaments via social media. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010, revised 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>The Webmaster shall be in charge of the ACF Website and maintain a current roster of members, including contact information. (Added by amendment 7/18/2010)</li>
 	<li> The Editors in Chief of ACF Fall, Regionals, and Nationals shall be responsible for ensuring timely completion of their respective question sets, and should periodically update the Officers of ACF on their progress towards that goal. (Amended 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>The Mirror Coordinator is responsible for soliciting bids for ACF Fall, Regionals, and Nationals, communicating with hosts about the proper packet-submission formats to use, and ensuring that hosts follow ACF’s Hosting Guidelines. (Added by amendment 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>The Treasurer is responsible for the finances of ACF's tournaments. The Treasurer shall centrally collect payments from teams and disburse payments to the editors and the host sites, making other payments as necessary. The Treasurer's duties include collecting all payments and enforcing all relevant penalties. (Added by amendment 5/8/2012)</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Art5"></a>Article 5. Quorum, Meetings, and Voting</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>A quorum shall exist at any meeting of the membership where at least 50% of the Full members are in attendance.</li>
 	<li>Meetings of the Academic Competition Federation will be called by the President as needed, and members are expected to attend if at all possible. They will be held in a chat room or some other convenient venue.</li>
 	<li>Reasons for holding a meeting include: member approval, editor assignment, discussion of amendments to the constitution and/or the rules, and Carper voting.</li>
 	<li>Full members are eligible to attend and vote at all meetings. Provisional members may not attend member approval meetings, may attend but not vote at editor assignment and amendment meetings, and may attend and vote at Carper meetings. Emeritus members may attend any meeting but may only vote at Carper meetings.</li>
 	<li>A vote of "abstain" signifies that a member is present but chooses not to vote. Abstaining members contribute to the quorum, but their votes are not considered in the numerator or the denominator for the purpose of totaling votes.</li>
 	<li>The only kind of meeting which must be held in a real-time venue (in person or via IRC) is a meeting to remove a member of ACF. "Meetings" for other purposes, including assigning editors, amending the constitution or rules, adding new members, or awarding the Carper Award may take the form of threads in the ACF forum on hsquizbowl.org.</li>
 	<li>After a reasonable opportunity for all ACF members to participate in a discussion on the forums, a vote may be held on any issue or amendment, also via the forums. A reasonable opportunity will be defined as one week from the opening of a discussion. The President or another Officer of ACF may agree that an issue constitutes an "emergency," in which case the one-week requirement does not apply. However, any issue so designated must be discussed at a real-time meeting, and the requirements for a successful vote (majority for ordinary issue, 2/3 for constitutional amendment) do not change. (Amended 05/02/2019)</li>
 	<li>Changes to the gameplay rules and eligibility rules are not considered constitutional amendments, and thus may be ratified with a simple majority rather than a 2/3 vote of full members.</li>
 	<li>The voting period for a vote of the Full Members, as called by the President, may last no longer than seven days, and must take place via electronic secret ballot through such means as the President sees fit (including, but not limited to, online forms, phpBB poll). If a member has not voted by the end of the designated voting period, that member will be treated as having abstained. (Added by amendment 8/27/2016)</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Art6"></a>Article 6. The Carper Award</h3>
<ol>
 	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The Dr. N. Gordon Carper Lifetime Achievement Award will be given annually at ACF Nationals to members of the quizbowl community who exhibit dedication to and long-term support of academic competitions as exemplified by the career of Dr. Carper.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Winners of the Carper Award needn’t be directly affiliated with ACF.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Only members of ACF may nominate or vote for any candidate for the Carper Award. All Full, Emeritus, and Provisional members shall be entitled both to nominate and vote for the Carper Award.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The Carper Award committee shall preside over the Carper Award voting and, within the strictures of the ACF Constitution, shall be empowered to devise reasonable procedures and rules for carrying out the function of selecting Carper Award winners. The Carper Award committee shall consist of each Carper Award winner who is a Full, Emeritus, or Provisional member of ACF. </span></li>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Bidding process
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate editor at the address listed above. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">When the editors receive more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: whom they expect to attract more teams, and whom they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Ideally, all bids will be received no later than twelve weeks before the tournament date, and the editors will award bids to hosts in each of the ten regions no later than ten weeks before the tournament date. In reality, only the more active regions are likely to have their bids decided by that time, and it may take some additional weeks before a host can be found in a less active region, so the announcement of bids may be staggered.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial breakdown between hosts and editors
</strong>The base fee for each "normal" team that participates in your tournament is $120, as described in the packet and fee guidelines. Of this, you can consider $70 the base fee for you, the host, and $50 the base fee for the editors. All packet discounts and penalties (including early/late packet adjustments, and supplementary penalties for formatting or plagiarism) are added to or subtracted from the $50 that is to be paid to the editors: For example, if a team submits their packet at the -$25 deadline, then (ignoring all other discounts) they pay you $95, and you still keep $70 and only send the editors $25 for that team, since the $25 comes out of the editors' share. Similarly, all logistical discounts for buzzers, laptops, staffers, and travel affect your cut: A team that has no packet adjustment and brings 1 buzzer and 1 staffer to the tournament pays $105; you keep $55 and send the editors $50, since the logistical discounts come out of your share. The $25 "new ACF team" discount is split 15/10: Take $15 out of the editors' share, and $10 out of the hosts' share.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The following unusual cases will have their fees split up differently: Teams which receive the new quizbowl team discount, teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and house teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which receive the "new quizbowl team discount" of $100, you do not owe the editors anything. Any money they do pay is yours. Normally, such teams will pay around $20. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams than from all others.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host keeps $21 and the editors get $14.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you can take a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial viability
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1200. You should expect to spend about $100 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament, send $500 to the editors, and keep $600 as your team's profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Host requirements
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must use the official <a style="color:#999999;" title="Official ACF Rules" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/official-acf-rules/">ACF rules</a> for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable "round reports"), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/index.html">here</a> . If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Unless a host receives explicit permission from the head editor to run fewer, at least ten meaningful games must be offered to all teams. ACF recommends offering at least eleven games.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team's PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors' share of the entry fees.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams should receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects at least four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament at the time when the trophies are ordered, then the top undergraduate team and the top Division II team should each receive a trophy. In fields of four or more teams competing for these titles, the top undergraduate and Division II teams will always be officially recognized as the undergraduate or Division II champions of the tournament, even if trophies are not available.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Payment from hosts to editors
</strong>You must postmark your check to the head editor for the full amount of the editors' share no later than two weeks after the tournament occurs. Only institutional and personal checks will be accepted - no money orders, no cash, and no purchase orders. If you have teams in your field who negotiated for late payment, then the editors will adjust the initially owed amount for this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Make it clear to your teams that they need to pay you on or before the morning of the tournament unless they make a specific arrangement with you for delayed payment. If you have problems collecting entry fees from your teams, contact the editors and they will help you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Many past tournaments have had to pull teeth in order to get hosts to pay the editors on time or at all. This is not acceptable and will not continue in the future. Editors put in a huge amount of work, make your tournament possible, and make it very explicit what they are owed when entering into the hosting agreement with you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have a particularly strange procedure at your school for cutting checks that may make it difficult to meet the two-week deadline, then please make this clear to editors several weeks BEFORE your tournament occurs, and they will negotiate a different deadline with you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>For ACF Nationals</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals</h2>
<strong>Bidding process
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate editor at the address listed above. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.

For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and/or receiving the $50 high school discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host keeps $21 and the editors get $14.

For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you can take a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.

ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.

<strong>Financial viability
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1200. You should expect to spend about $100 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament, send $500 to the editors, and keep $600 as your team's profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.

<strong>Host requirements
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.

Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.

Hosts must use the official <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/acfrules_final.pdf">ACF rules</a> for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.

Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable "round reports"), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/index.html">here</a> . If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.

We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team's PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.

Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors' share of the entry fees.

<em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams should receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects at least four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament at the time when the trophies are ordered, then the top undergraduate team and the top Division II team should each receive a trophy. In fields of four or more teams competing for these titles, the top undergraduate and Division II teams will always be officially recognized as the undergraduate or Division II champions of the tournament, even if trophies are not available.

<em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers.

<strong>Payment from hosts to editors
</strong>You must postmark your check to the head editor for the full amount of the editors' share no later than two weeks after the tournament occurs. Only institutional and personal checks will be accepted - no money orders, no cash, and no purchase orders. If you have teams in your field who negotiated for late payment, then the editors will adjust the initially owed amount for this.

Make it clear to your teams that they need to pay you on or before the morning of the tournament unless they make a specific arrangement with you for delayed payment. If you have problems collecting entry fees from your teams, contact the editors and they will help you.

Many past tournaments have had to pull teeth in order to get hosts to pay the editors on time or at all. This is not acceptable and will not continue in the future. Editors put in a huge amount of work, make your tournament possible, and make it very explicit what they are owed when entering into the hosting agreement with you.

If you have a particularly strange procedure at your school for cutting checks that may make it difficult to meet the two-week deadline, then please make this clear to editors several weeks BEFORE your tournament occurs, and they will negotiate a different deadline with you.
<h2>For ACF Nationals
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#444444;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;">The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.</span></h2>
For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.

If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.

The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.]]></content:encoded>

All packets should be submitted to the head editor at the address listed in the table . A good subject line for an e-mail with your packet submission attached would be "[Tournament Name] Packet Submission: [Your team name here]." E.g., "ACF Regionals 2009: Northwestern A."

</table>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>* Discounts in red are for optional packets. If you have any questions about this please read on.</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All the deadline days are Sundays. Packets must be submitted by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the specified days to count for that day's discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals 2012, a discount of $100 will be offered for packets that are submitted by January 23, 2012.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="required"></a>Who is required to submit packets?</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2010 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2011-2012. All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals count as regular collegiate academic tournaments for this purpose, but trash or "hybrid" tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT "invitational series" questions do not. This test is applied to each individual team, not to your school's contingent as a whole. If, for example, your school sends three teams, and your A and C teams have a person who played college tournaments in 2006, but your B team does not, then only your A and C teams need to write packets. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please ask the appropriate editor at the address above. Exceptional cases, such as having one person on your team who played some tournaments ten years ago and is now returning to school, will be evaluated by the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament. The editors may grant one or more 24-hour extensions to the final deadline at an additional penalty of $10 per day. However, what will certainly not be allowed is for an experienced team to simply not write a packet at all. You may not "pay your way out of writing."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams comprised entirely of players who did not play a regular collegiate academic tournament prior to September 1, 2010 do not have to submit packets. However, you have the option of submitting a packet if you want to. For such teams, submitting a packet by the normal -$25 deadline will get you a -$50 discount, and submitting by the normal no-penalty deadline will get you a -$25 discount. Optional packets will not be accepted past the no-penalty deadline.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets should not be exposed to anyone outside of the specific team that is writing the packet; in all likelihood, your school's A team will play on the packet written by your school's B team, et cetera, so it is imperative that questions be kept blind to all competitors. This strictly applies to all potential players at the tournament – if you are on the B team, do not write questions for the A team's packet, even if you offer to sit out when that packet is read.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">See <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">below</a> for additional, but easy-to-avoid, packet penalties.</span>

</table>
<span style="color:#999999;">Buzzer, staffer, laptop, travel, and international discounts apply to your school's total fee, not to each individual team's fee. The minimum total fee for a school is $0.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="discounts"></a>Discounts for shorthanded teams in financial duress:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which meet all of the following conditions, further discounts are available:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">A team of less than 3 people</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The team is being funded directly by its members (rather than by its school or by a team budget)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">If required to write a packet, the team writes a packet before the no-penalty deadline and it is of acceptable quality</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Under those circumstances, solo teams will get a discount of -$80 and two-person teams will get a discount of -$60. The teams will still be eligible for further discounts down to the minimum $0 fee.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams who are unable to pay the fee on the day of the tournament but do not qualify for the above discount may negotiate for delayed payment (of the full fee) with the editors and their site's tournament director. It is the policy of ACF that the inability to come up with money by the tournament date will never exclude a team from playing in a tournament, as long as we can trust you to pay eventually (in practice, this usually means "if you have not had issues with paying what you owe in the past").</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a>Additional packet penalties:</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><strong>
</strong></span></span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><em>Formatting:
</em></span><span class="Apple-style-span">If your packet deviates in a major way from the formatting guidelines (random tabs and page breaks throughout, questions not sorted by category, every question has answers without the required part being indicated, etc) you will incur a $30 penalty on top of any other fees or discounts.</span><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has a large accumulation of minor deviations from the formatting guidelines (ten or more examples of no underlining, bonus parts preceded by letters or parentheses instead of bracketed numbers, bonus leadins or "for 10 points" not in proper format, etc) you will incur a $15 penalty.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has absolute compliance with the formatting guidelines you will get a $5 discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Formatting packets on the editing end because you chose not to follow the guidelines is necessary in order to make the packets clear for moderators, but it's also a HUGE timesink and there's no reason you can't do it properly while writing and leave us the time to edit the content of your questions instead. Please observe the formatting guidelines below and don't make the editor charge you a penalty for this. A few minor problems with formatting will not incur a penalty – we are not looking to screw anyone with the formatting penalties, and will reserve them only for packets that really cause headaches.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Plagiarism:
</em>If you submit a packet with any question in it that the editors can prove you plagiarized from an existing source, your packet fee will be +$200, your packet will not be used, and you will bring shame upon your entire family. Please read more about plagiarism <a style="color:#999999;" href="#plagiarism">here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prohibited types of questions:
</em>This is certainly not intended to penalize new teams for writing weak questions in general, but rather penalize people for writing specific types of questions which no one should be writing, ever, and which are specifically prohibited here.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a spelling question, that's +$25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple spelling questions, but you most certainly should not be doing that). Spelling questions are completely archaic in quizbowl today and reflect very lazy writing, yet at least one was submitted to a tournament recently, so we want to remind everyone that there should never, ever be a question asking people to spell anything.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a question with clues or phrasing from Wikipedia that cannot be verified with any other source, that's $25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple questions out of Wikipedia, however your packet will likely be returned if you do that; see below).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a "given the x, name the y" binary matching bonus with no prose clues at all, that's +$5 for each bonus of that kind. This could potentially be charged for as many as all 24 of your bonuses, but, of course, you can avoid it by not writing these bonuses. See below for details on what exactly is meant by this type of question. These questions are prohibited because they are extremely boring, especially to teams who do not know the answer. Write bonuses that maintain the attention of all teams and educate those who do not know about the bonus topic.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a 5-10-15 bonus, that's also +$5 for each bonus of that kind. Once more, this could potentially be charged for however many bonuses you write in this way, and once more, you should avoid this penalty by not writing any such bonuses. 5-10-15s shift the balance of rewarded skills too much towards knowing "hard parts" and depress scoring in games between teams of average ability, and should simply be changed to 10-10-10s.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">There is no reason any team should end up being charged a penalty for the above types of specifically prohibited questions, since this section spells out exactly how to avoid that. The editor assures you that if you are just an inexperienced writer submitting bad questions because of said inexperience, we will not try to gouge you out of money, and indeed will appreciate the effort you put into writing questions when you are unfamiliar with doing so. The only questions that will face financial surcharges are the specifically prohibited kinds above.</span>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="philosophy"></a>Writing philosophy</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Consult individual tournament announcements for further difficulty guidelines (generally, ACF Regionals is a "normal difficulty" tournament, ACF Fall is quite easy). The below tips apply to all tournaments.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Tossups</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Dead tossups are the enemy of having fun at quizbowl tournaments, so above all, do not do not DO NOT write tossups on answers that are obscure (for ACF Fall and Regionals. For Nationals, some more leeway is permitted in the sense that you do not have to reasonably expect that everyone will know the answer, but you still should not write for only the top 3 teams.) Use easy answers, and make your early-in-the-question clues hard to provide the challenge, rather than using challenging answers for tossups. Ideally, there should be almost no tossups in the tournament which go unanswered at the end. If you want to ask about something harder, use it as one part of a bonus that also contains two easier parts, not as a tossup answer or as the subject for an entire bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"> Use interesting clues throughout your tossup. Avoid writing tossups which "fall off the difficulty cliff" before the "For 10 points" – e.g., if you write a tossup on Pietro Mascagni, don't put in five lines of superhard material followed by "For 10 points, name this composer of Cavalliera Rusticana." Either write on something else, or use the "in one of his operas, such-and-such happens" clue style to provide useful middle clues. All tossups should have those middle clues, not just a sudden dropoff in difficulty at the end. In a game between two good teams, almost no tossups should go past "For 10 points" before someone buzzes.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Bonus questions</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For bonus parts, prose clues are greatly preferred to abrupt phrases or lists. Bonuses composed entirely of sentence fragments, such as the "given the holiday, name the religion in which it is celebrated" type of bonus questions, are prohibited and will incur penalties (see above). You can write the same bonus as "name these religions" and work the same clues into some more aesthetically pleasing complete sentences.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This is what is meant by a prohibited binary matching bonus:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works from characters, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, Manolin, a shark</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Old Man and the Sea</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Margaret, Robert Wilson, a lion</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell, The Grand Maestro, Renata</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Across the River and Into the Trees</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This is what you should write instead:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, who has not caught a fish in eighty-five days, wrestles with an enormous marlin only to have it eaten by sharks during the trip back to Havana's harbor, in this late novella.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Old Man and the Sea</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] In this short story, a former cosmetics model threatens to leave her husband, who was revealed as a coward during a lion hunt. Margaret eventually shoots the title character during an encounter with a buffalo, and Robert Wilson approves.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell shoots ducks on the way to Venice's Gritti Palace Hotel, then Cantwell and Countess Renata get it on in a gondola. After buying a brooch, Cantwell joins the Order of Brusadelli and dies of a heart attack at the end of this novel.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Across the River and Into the Trees</strong></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">See how the second example teaches something and recaps interesting parts of the story so that even people who don't know the answers get something out of the question? This is what you should write. Notice that you can still incorporate most or all the clues from the bad bonus in example 1 into the better clues from example 2, so writing good questions does not have to mean writing harder questions. Note that "Given a line from a poem, name the poem" with no other clues still counts as a binary matching bonus and should not be written.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Furthermore, please use actual clues in your bonus leadins whenever possible. For example, if you are writing a bonus about Chandragupta, but can't use his name in the leadin because it is the first answer, do not write "Answer the following about an Indian ruler for 10 points each." instead, write "He was the founder of the Mauryan dynasty. For 10 points each:" and include a second clue in the first part. This keeps people from being bored by filler words and provides extra space for more clues, thus making it more likely that players will get questions right.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Write nearly all of your bonus questions as above: 3 parts worth 10 points each, with one part being no harder than a tossup answer, another being slightly more challenging, and the remaining part being harder still, though still something you would expect a person well-read in the subject of the bonus to know in five seconds. If you are unsure about the difficulty of a particular question, then you should probably err on the side of easier and write on something else instead. You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10, if this seems necessary to you for some reason. The 30-20-10 format and other multi-part, single-answer bonus questions are not permitted in ACF, nor is the 5-10-15 format. The 5-10-15 specifically just has no sensible place in quizbowl and will incur a financial penalty as described above; just write the same question as a 10-10-10.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not use any other aberrant bonus formats such as listing six things for 5 points each, but if you come up with a really great bonus in such a format, it will constitute an acceptable part of your packet and the editors will consider using it. However, all bonus scoring schemes must have a one-to-one relationship between each answer and a certain amount of points – ACF will never use bonuses of the "name four things, 5 points each and an extra 10 for all correct" type. Bonuses that involve putting things in any sort of correct order or rank, regardless of the scoring scheme, are prohibited.</span>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Clues and Answers to Avoid:</span></h2>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#999999;">You may find it useful to review <a style="color:#999999;" title="Subash Maddipoti’s Tips on Question Writing" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipoti's Ten Tips For Question Writing</a>. Keep in mind this important point from the above document:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You should omit useless information such as "His intermittent surrealist depictions and use of vivid color belied the realism and monochromatic pigments that the public associated with him." This sort of knowledge is of course very important to fully understanding whatever painter we're talking about in a classroom context, but phrased in that manner, it simply does not help anyone in a match get the question, no matter how much he or she knows about art. Make sure every clue in your tossups is a specific, helpful, and uniquely identifying piece of information about the answer.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please apply that point to ALL of your questions and omit useless nonclues like "the protagonist of this novel is a thoughtful, sensitive man hardened by circumstance" or "this psychologist graduated from secondary school in London and briefly studied at Oxford." Clues which point to dozens of possible answers, rather than one, or which are just boring biographical details with no relevance to the reason that the answer is important are what we mean by "nonclues."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">In particular, please do not tell us where or when someone was born, what their father's profession was, or where they went to college. We don't care and neither do the people who will be playing your questions – instead, talk about interesting, memorable, and unique things that this person did in their field of prominence.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not put useless phrases like "from clues" or "from descriptions" in your bonus leadins. For example, write "name these British novels for 10 points each;" don't write "name these British novels from clues for 10 points each." It is understood that the bonus will contain clues and that players are not expected to just divine three works of English literature upon hearing the bonus leadin, so don't waste time and space putting in those phrases.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Avoid using words such as "famously" "well known" or "best" in your questions. These are subjective and unhelpful terms. Replace them with specific, concrete information about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that the first instance of any pronoun (he, she, it, they) or form of the word "this" in a tossup must always refer only to the answer, and subsequent pronouns and demonstrative adjectives should be thoroughly scrutinized for any potential to mislead players.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="alternate"></a><strong>Alternate Answers:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember to include these forms of alternate answers:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the reverse names for Supreme Court cases; also, in cases where neither party name is "the United States" or the name of a state, one party name is sufficient to get the question right, and the underlining should reflect this.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for any work of literature/art not originally in English</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for people with descriptive words in their names</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the birth name of people who are well-known by a pseudonym</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both formal and native language names for countries as alternate answers (both Britannica and the CIA Factbook are quick places to find all the names used for a country)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both the Pinyin and Wade-Giles forms of Romanized Chinese names and other Chinese words</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">When including alternate answer notes, omit needlessly long phrases such as "also accept;" simply write "or." Do not include insulting notes such as "begrudgingly accept" or "accept from people who can't speak French." Either an answer is acceptable, or it is not; no further commentary is desired. Follow the below models and use only "or" and "prompt on" as appropriate for alternate answers that are acceptable at any point in the question.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong> v. Connecticut [or Connecticut v. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Romer</span></strong> v. Evans [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evans</span></strong> v. Romer]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Elixir of Love</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">L'Elisir d'amore</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim I</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim the Grim</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim Yavuz</span></strong>; prompt on "Selim"]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: John <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wayne</span></strong> [or Marion Robert<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Morrison</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Republic of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azerbaijan</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azarbaycan</span></strong> Respublikasi]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cixi</span></strong> (see-shee) [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tzuhsi</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xiaoqin</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xianhuanghou</span></strong>]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Use "accept ___ before it is read" when a potential alternate answer is used in the question. Do not use asterisks within the question text to denote this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Example:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: George <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Orwell</span></strong> [accept <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eric Blair</span></strong> before it is read]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Additional notes on answer lines:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For the moderator's convenience, list answers in the expected order of likelihood of hearing them from a team (this usually means English titles first). Remember to underline answers in accordance with the ACF rules on required parts; specifically, you should usually not underline a leading "The" or its equivalent in other languages. Also note that it is not necessary to include phonetically identical alternate spellings on the answer line.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="length"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Question length</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">The edited packets for most ACF events will have tossups of no more than 6-7 lines and bonus parts of no more than 2 (in 10-point Times New Roman with one-inch margins). You should submit slightly longer questions so that we can whittle out excess words or remove a repeated clue and end up with questions of the desired final length. One or two tossups of 4-5 lines are acceptable, but a whole packet of them is probably not deep enough. Likewise, writing more than a handful of tossups that are longer than 9 lines is pointless, since we will be eliminating a lot of your clues if you do that to make all tossups fit under the final length cap.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><em>Example tossup construction:</em></strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">For an example of what we mean by interesting and useful clues: a tossup on Henry VIII should start off talking about his specific relationships to some lesser-known historical incidents and people, such as:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Agents of this king executed Richard Whiting at Toe Hill. Earlier, he joined Aragon's war with France, winning great popularity when his general, the Earl of Surrey, defeated a Scottish force at Flodden Field.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">The question should then talk about some material likely to be encountered in an undergraduate course dealing with Henry VIII but still lesser-known to the casual person:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prior to authorizing the Ten Articles, he sponsored the construction of such ships as the Mary Rose. He also suppressed the Pilgrimage of Grace and wrestled with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Then, the tossup should go on to hint at what he is best-known for with clues like</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>He attempted to persuade Pope Clement VII to intercede against his own violation of Leviticus, despite earlier using Deuteronomy to win the support of Julius II.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Finally, the question should conclude with some names widely associated with Henry and the giveaway clue:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>His chancellors Thomas Wolsey and Thomas More both fell out of his good graces, leading to the martyrdom of More during this man's creation of the Church of England. For 10 points, name this father of Elizabeth I and husband to Catherine Parr, Anne Boleyn, and four other women.</em></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This question rewards deep knowledge and teaches something interesting to those who didn't know much about Henry VIII before, yet it is still, ultimately, a tossup on a very well known answer which presumably every team can get by the last clue. Such tossups are what we are looking for in your packet submissions. Note also that the tossup, when put together, is noticeably longer than the 6-line cap we will be enforcing on the edited questions – again, please submit your questions this way so that we can edit them into very dense 6-line tossups for the final packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">A question on Henry VIII which relies on things like birth dates or quotations is very boring and is probably not usable, while a question which starts off saying something like "He was a longtime rival of the Papacy and finally took drastic action against it" encourages wild guessing based on minimal knowledge and does not allow players with deeper knowledge of the subject to get the tossup first, and is not usable for those reasons. Similarly, literature questions should rely on plot scenarios and character names first, less so on rote association of titles with authors, in order to reward people who have actually read the books. Myth questions that are on traditional topics such as specific deities should talk about interesting anecdotes involving the figure, not just be a boring list of stock clues like "his symbol was a hexahedron made of onyx, his temple was at Rondopolis, his head looked like a badger's." If such clues are the most well known thing about the figure in question, they do have a place at the end of a tossup, but they should not comprise the whole question. Similar principles apply to all categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Questions on people have a major place in the tournament but should be balanced by questions on works, events, concepts, etc.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="distribution"></a></span></h2>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Distribution: </span></h2>

	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Astronomy, earth science/geology, or other science not covered above: 1 question</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don't write a second question on any of the "minor" fields. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Less experienced writers are discouraged from writing tossups on chemical elements, programming languages, or subatomic particles, as such questions are difficult to write well. Within "any science," a maximum of 1 question on the history of science is allowed. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered straight science rather than science history, so you should feel free to write such questions for the relevant category. Questions which straddle the line between biology and chemistry, or chemistry and physics, should be reserved for the "any science" section of the science distribution, so that clear-cut answers can be used in the parts formally marked for the three large branches.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Philosophy: 1/1 (different parts of philosophical history)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Less experienced writers are discouraged from writing questions on pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, as such questions are difficult to write well.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Please write between 1 and 2 total questions on distinctly non-Western things for the overall RMP category.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion (e.g., the Council of Chalcedon) for either history or religion, but don't write about religious history for both categories. A question which could be considered either religion or myth (e.g., Brahma) can be counted as one of your religion questions.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Fine Arts 3/3</strong></span>
<ul>Painting: 1/1 Classical music excluding opera: 1/1 Everything else: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film, or other arts not covered under painting or classical music)</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Please pick one largely visual category and one largely auditory category for your "everything else" subjects – e.g, pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Social Science 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. The two questions should not come from the same field of study. Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Geography 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Also, please do not write both questions on the same area of the world. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above, or you can write questions which mix categories here. If you write two trash questions then they should not be from the same general category (e.g. one should be on sports and one on TV, or one on music and one on video games; don't write both on visual media or both on sports).</span></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="formatting"></a>Formatting:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that if you don't meet these formatting requirements, we will charge you a <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">penalty</a>, so pay close attention to this section. We are aware that these are very specific requirements and may seem like overkill, but when multiplied by 10 or 20 packets, any slight variations in formatting become a major distraction from the kind of work we really need to be doing on the actual content of the questions, so we would really appreciate everyone following the formatting guidelines religiously.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets must be submitted as some sort of file that can with certainty be opened properly on any computer running Microsoft Word 2002 and can support all of the formatting requirements below. I.e.: submitting them as .doc files, .rtf files, or an exact equivalent to either is strongly preferred. Packets submitted as Word 2007 .docx files are NOT acceptable since those files cannot be opened on older versions of Word. If any of the editors cannot open your packet on the first try, it will be returned and you will have to fix it before it is considered submitted for fee purposes. The filename should be the name of your school, with the letter designating your specific team if your school is sending more than one. USC.doc, UCLA B.doc, or Irvine A.doc are examples of file names we wish to see.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please consult the sample properly <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/acf/formatting-sample.doc">formatted packet</a>. Make your questions look as much like that, aesthetically, as possible, while using the appropriate difficulty level for the particular tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Everything in your packet should be in Times New Roman font of size 10. Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">At the top of the packet, put, in boldface, the tournament name (e.g, <strong>ACF Fall 2008</strong> or <strong>ACF Regionals 2009</strong>), followed on the next line by your school name. Be sure to designate whether it is the A team, B team, etc if your school is sending multiple teams. This should be followed by the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Thus, the top of every packet should look something like this:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>ACF Regionals 2009
Packet by Reno Tech B Team (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Format your tossups like this:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Toward the end of its first act, one of the characters sings "I Know You Hate Me" after being whipped by the protagonist's wife. A peasant sings "Why Hast Thou Taught Me" to woo the hand of that wife, who is known as Columbine in Act Two. After Beppe sings an ode to Columbine, the protagonist confronts Nedda about Silvio, and when she brushes him off he stabs her, leading Tonio to end the opera with the line "La Commedia Finita." For 10 points, name this opera by Ruggierio Leoncavallo, whose first act ends with the melancholy "Vesti La Giubba" and whose protagonist is a very sad clown.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <em>I <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pagliacci</span></strong></em> [or The <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Clowns</span></strong></em>]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The last sentence begins with "For 10 points" (not FTP or For ten points) followed by a comma and a space (not by a colon, a dash, or nothing).</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The question text DOES NOT begin with a number or an indentation.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Format your bonus questions like these:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">It was a response to the prejudiced selections of the official Salon de Paris. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Name this art exhibition which was first held in 1863.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salon des Refuses</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salon of the Rejected</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] One of the prominent paintings exhibited in the Salon des Refusés was this huge Edouard Manet painting depicting a nude woman sitting between two clothed men in an outdoor setting.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <em>Le <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dejeuner sur l'Herbe</span></strong></em> [or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Luncheon on the Grass</span></strong></em>; or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Picnic on the Grass</span></strong></em>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Salon des Refuses also featured The White Girl, a painting by this American artist. The painting is also known as his Symphony in White, Number 1.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: James McNeill <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whistler</span></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Name these places that one might see on a peaceful trip down the Danube, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Danube originates in this wooded mountain area in the far southwest of Germany which extends from Säckingen to Durlach.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Forest</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schwarzwald</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Before emptying into the Black Sea, the river passes through this capital of Slovakia.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bratislava</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Rhine-Main-Danube canal allows continuous travel from the Danube to the Rhine Delta, which is found on the North Sea at this city, the second most populous in the Netherlands and the busiest port in the world.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rotterdam</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets and separated from each other by semicolons.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The bonus instruction indicates that the three parts are valued "for 10 points each" and either forms a general instruction for the whole bonus (in which case it ends with a period) or provides a specific clue pertaining to the first part of the bonus (in which case it ends with a colon).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples of the two different types of bonus instructions:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these novels by Charlotte Bronte, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Identify these characters from Plato's Symposium, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Name these authors of works set in the Netherlands, for 10 points each.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">He drew a perfect circle to demonstrate his artistic prowess to the Pope. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> The Longmen Grottoes and White Horse Temple are among the religious artifacts found here. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> According to Hesiod, she is the daughter of Ceto and Phorcys. For 10 points each:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write any bonus questions using different point schemes, then make sure to clearly reflect how the points will be awarded in the bonus instruction. If you use a "for the stated points" bonus format, then the value of each part should be indicated both in the brackets and in the text of the bonus parts themselves, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">His essay "Some Remarks on Logical Form" and a preface he wrote for a dictionary for elementary schools are collected in his<em>Philosophical Occasions</em>. For the stated points:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, name this twentieth-century philosopher of language, whose aphorisms are collected in such books as <em>Culture and Value</em> and<em>Zettel</em>.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Ludwig <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wittgenstein</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, at the end of this first book by Wittgenstein, he asserts that anyone who has understood the book's propositions can now discard them as one would discard a ladder after climbing it.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, Wittgenstein's most important later book is this work which claims that concepts denote "family resemblances" between things and argues that there cannot be a "private language."</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Philosophical Investigations</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, Wittgenstein once threatened this author of The Open Society and its Enemies and proponent of falsificationism with a fireplace poker.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Karl Raimund <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Popper</span></strong></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Standardization of numbers:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. "twenty-two years", "a million dollars" and "fourteen hundred casualties," but "For 10 points" and "1976.") Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Other notes on formatting and grammar:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please delete all of your internal notes from the packet before submitting it. Editors do not want to see stuff like "lit: american (FF)" scattered throughout the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Pay attention to parallel structure and the antecedents of pronouns. Some rules of grammar can and should be ignored in order to make your questions pyramidal and concise, but those two are actually very helpful in making your tossups understandable. When you start a sentence with "The king won victories at Battle A, Battle B, and...", you need to conclude it with "Battle C," not "promoted his foreign secretary to vizier." You also need to make sure to avoid stray "this" and "it"s in your questions – if you want to refer back to a previous sentence, use a form of "that" instead to avoid confusing people about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use any unusual Word templates, and pay attention when converting text from other file formats. If you paste something in, use the "paste as unformatted text" option so it doesn't bring a minefield of crazy style tags with it. There should not be any point in your document where that little template box in Word says anything besides "Normal."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Manual line breaks, tabs, and that little thing that looks like a degree sign should not be used ever. There should be nothing in your document besides letters, numbers, standard punctuation, italics, bold, underlining, spaces, and paragraph returns.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that using parsimony in non-essential words keeps players from being bored and makes it easier for us to get tossups down to six lines and bonus parts down to two. E.g., "name" instead of "answer questions regarding" in bonus leadins.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Use one inch margins in your packets. This makes it possible for standardized length requirements to be meaningful.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use the subjunctive when the simple past is suitable. Instead of "He would go on to write Bricks Without Straw" , say "He wrote Bricks Without Straw" or "He went on to write Bricks Without Straw." It just sounds better, places the clue more concretely in time, and usually saves words.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="pronunciation"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation Guides:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation guides are usually a waste of time, to be honest. Put them in only under the following conditions:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">You actually know how to pronounce the word and are not just guessing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The pronunciation guide itself is clear.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">There is a substantial chance that the word will be mispronounced without the guide, and that the mispronunciation of the word will make it unrecognizable to players or mislead them into thinking it is a different clue. E.g.., don't put in guides like "Nabokov (nuh-BAHK-off)" – even though that is correct, no player is going to be confused if they hear the incorrect pronunciation "NAH-buh-kov," so you're just wasting everyone's time putting the guide in.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Or, if it's an answer, there's a substantial chance that a moderator will not recognize the correct pronunciation because it differs substantially from the appearance of the word on the page. Chinese words transliterated with an "x" standing for an "sh" sound or a "zh" standing for a "j" sound are common pitfalls here, and should receive pronunciation guides in answers.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">If you choose to put in a pronunciation guide under the above circumstances, put it in parentheses, with phonetic spelling and emphasized syllables in all caps, immediately after the relevant word, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Arthur Rubinstein commissioned a Fantasia by this man, who wrote incidental music to the dramas The Passion and Daybreak. One of his works contains a ritornello in the section "Jota" (HO-tuh). His stage works include the puppet opera The Tale of Master Pedro...</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [etc, etc]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Manuel de Falla</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="wikipedia"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia reminder:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia is not a reliable source for meeting the stringent standards of factual accuracy which quizbowl questions must maintain. We will not accept any questions containing clues whose only source is Wikipedia. If you use Wikipedia in your question writing process, then you should cross-check each and every clue gleaned from any Wikipedia article with an established source. It will probably be more time-efficient for you to avoid using Wikipedia at all. If you are having trouble finding good places to look up information for questions, please contact the editor of the tournament you are writing for.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets containing questions which are determined to have come solely from Wikipedia will be returned for rewriting and will not count as submitted for purposes of the fee schedule until such questions have been replaced. You will also be <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">charged $25</a> on top of your eventual fee for submitting your revised packet.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="plagiarism"></a>Plagiarism and recycling: </span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism of any kind in your packet submissions for this tournament is absolutely unacceptable. In general, anything that is considered plagiarism for coursework at your school will be considered plagiarism in your submitted packet. In particular, note that our concept of plagiarism includes but is not limited to lifting wording directly from Wikipedia, Britannica, or any encyclopedia, webpage, book, or other reference source without attribution; and taking questions or parts of questions from previously existing quizbowl packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams caught plagiarizing will have their packets rejected and will not be given the opportunity to write a replacement. Such teams will be substantially penalized, as per the notice in the penalties section--i.e., you will either be charged hundreds of dollars, or kicked out of the tournament. We promise you that we WILL catch you if you are plagiarizing. Please make sure that every person writing for your packet is fully aware of the consequences of plagiarism.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Also, your packet may not include any questions that were previously submitted to any tournament whatsoever. Even if your previous questions were not used at the other tournament, you do not know for certain who assisted the editors of the prior tournament or otherwise may have seen your questions, and thus you cannot guarantee that the people who saw your questions are not playing in this tournament. While less serious than plagiarism, question recycling is, likewise, totally prohibited and will result in bad things happening to you, so you should take pains to avoid engaging in this practice.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Thank you for your patience is getting through these long guidelines. They are long and detailed because we want to put on the best tournaments possible, with the best packets possible. Please contact the appropriate tournament editor if you have any further questions.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is a document by ACF member Andrew Hart. It was  intended to help teams write difficulty appropriate questions for ACF Winter, but generally the content is helpful for teams writing questions for any "regular-difficulty" tournament.</em></span>

This guide attempts to elucidate just what editors envision by “regular difficulty.”

Before we start, I want to produce some understanding about the basic distinction between a novice or "easy" tournament (e.g. ACF Fall) and a regular tournament (eg. ACF Regionals.) At a regular tournament, there is a basic threshold of knowledge that will be required to get ten points on a bonus, or to convert a tossup, and some teams will probably not be up to that threshold. Some tossups and some easy bonus parts will be on very easy answers, and some will be on less easy answers, and that’s not a problem.

There are going to be teams playing a regular tournament who simply fall below the basic threshold of knowledge so much that they are not part of this tournament’s target audience; we surely encourage them to play if they are enthusiastic about doing so, but we cannot write regular tournaments with them in mind. When you consider how easy or difficult a tossup answer or bonus part is, it is not necessary to take into consideration these teams.

For tossups:
<ul>
	<li>Editors will often state a length limit for the final tournament; for example, that tossups will not exceed seven lines. Many editors allow submissions to exceed this amount, because they appreciate having more quality clues to work with.</li>
	<li>Tossup answers should be chosen to maximize an ideal distribution of buzzes. This means that there should be a few very knowledgeable people buzzing on the first few clues, a significant number of players buzzing on the middle clues, and that a vast majority of teams will have buzzed by the end of the question. Tossup answers should not be chosen such that only a few very knowledgeable players are buzzing on the middle clues, and most teams are waiting until the end to buzz.</li>
	<li>Do not pick tossup answers that will result in the tossup going dead for a significant number of rooms.</li>
	<li>Your clues should gently slope from difficult to the giveaway; there should be no drastic difficulty cliffs. In order to accomplish this, you should always describe something before you give its name. The larger the contingent of players you think will be buzzing on the name, the more detailed the description of the thing should be.</li>
</ul>
For bonuses:
<ul>
	<li>Regular-difficulty tournaments often have specific conversion goals for bonuses as a whole, as well as specific difficulty standards to ensure that each bonus will be uniform.</li>
	<li>On the whole, editors often want the very best teams to be able to well exceed 20 points per bonus; all well-balanced and knowledgeable teams to be able to get 20 points per bonus; the median bonus conversion to be around 15; and few, if any, teams in the target audience to fall below 10 points per bonus.</li>
	<li>For each individual bonus, there should be a clear easy, middle, and hard part.</li>
	<li>The easy part should be something that any team with basic knowledge of the subject at hand will know. Note that this means that the subject you pick has to somehow lend itself to an acceptably easy part (we’re going off of the standard that 90% of teams in the target audience should convert the easy part).</li>
	<li>The middle part should test for beyond-basic knowledge of the subject at hand. It should also be eminently answerable to any team with more than the bare minimum of knowledge. Numerically, the median team in the target audience should be converting just over half of these parts, and the best teams should be converting this part almost all the time.</li>
	<li>The hard part should test for deep knowledge of the subject at hand, but it should not be impossible. It should also be important and not trivial to the subject at hand. It should also not be a “stock” answer that is very guessable based on recent packets. Numerically, the median team should be getting these parts sporadically when they have deep knowledge of a subject, while the best teams convert them regularly but not perfunctorily.</li>
</ul>
A general rule to sum this all up: When in doubt, err on the side of making your answers easier.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><em>This page was archived on 16 June 2015</em></span></strong>

<span style="color:#999999;">For a printable PDF copy of the official ACF rules, <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/acfrules-final.pdf">click here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>ACF has announced updates to its eligibility rules, which will go into effect in Academic Year 2015-16. Please check the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16952">announcement</a> for details.</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>ACF RULES FOR GAMEPLAY, TOURNAMENT EXECUTION, AND PLAYER ELIGIBILITY</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">These rules are © 2007 the Academic Competition Federation. Some portions of these rules were, with permission, based on the copyrighted rules of the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence. Any tournament may use these rules without owing any financial obligation to the Academic Competition Federation, or any other obligation except for giving credit to the Academic Competition Federation as the author of these rules. Tournaments may modify these rules as long as such modifications, and their source, are clearly noted.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>A. Tournament Participants and Roles</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> Every room will have a moderator who presents the packet of questions to the teams. The scorekeeper records the activity of the game on an official scoresheet. The tournament director may appoint additional officials to help manage the competition. A moderator may act as his own scorekeeper, or, if both teams consent, may ask a player or spectator to keep the official score.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> A team member is an eligible individual on the roster of a particular team. See section C for eligibility rules.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> The team captain is a member of the team who is in the game and is responsible for giving answers when prompted on bonus questions, as described in rule F.1. The team captain is self-designated at the start of each game and may change this designation to another player in the game before the start of any tossup. If the team captain is substituted out, he must indicate, upon departing, who the new captain is. Especially at the high school level, some or all of the team captain’s functions may actually be governed by the coach, as described in rule A.5.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> The tournament director is the self-designated on-site organizer of a particular tournament and has final discretion in all decisions about protests and behavioral sanctions. For ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, and ACF Nationals, the “editors” of a tournament are the individuals assigned to coordinate the production of the packet set, which, for Fall and Regionals, is then distributed to the tournament directors at various sites to be played. For all other collegiate tournaments using these rules, and for all high school tournaments using these rules, the functions assigned to the “editors” are instead the responsibility of the tournament director.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> On a team with more than four players on its roster, the team members are responsible for selecting their own lineup for each game and deciding on substitutions. Only players in the game may file protests. Players are free to follow the instruction of any outside coach or other person in making these decisions, and should be given reasonable accommodation by moderators to consult with their coaches over possible protests. When using these rules for high school tournaments, a large or complete degree of control by coaches over the team’s decisions is expected in some areas. Local traditions about the role of the coach should be followed.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>B. General Rules of Conduct</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> All teams, staff, and spectators must adhere to the highest standard of ethics. Participants are expected to compete in a civil, sportsmanlike manner.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> Cheating will not be tolerated. Any team member or spectator found to be party to cheating will be expelled from the competition immediately. At the discretion of the tournament director, the results of games in which cheating was found to occur may be changed to forfeits. All participants share a responsibility to report instances where cheating may have occurred and are expected to cooperate fully and honestly in investigations of potential cheating.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> Any player, staffer, or spectator may be ejected from the tournament for one egregious behavioral offense, such as discriminatory language, cheating, fighting, or destruction of the host institution’s property; or for a pattern of lesser offenses, as defined and warned by the tournament director, over the course of the day. The tournament director has sole and non-appealable discretion over ejections.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>C. Player and Team Eligibility</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> For high school tournaments, or high school teams competing in collegiate tournaments, eligibility may be governed by a state association of athletic directors, quizbowl coaches, or so forth. When applicable, eligibility rules put forth by those groups will take the place of rules C.2 through C.8.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> For high school tournaments, players must be enrolled at the school for which they are playing, or have graduated in the same academic year that the tournament is being held. For collegiate tournaments, players must be taking classes for credit (or doing equivalent undergraduate or graduate work) in a degree program, during the academic year in which the tournament takes place, under the aegis of the school for which they are playing. Summer sessions are considered part of the preceding academic year for the purpose of this rule only, but not for any other rules. All graduate students who are doing work towards a degree are eligible, as are all high school students dual-enrolled in college programs. Holding any prior degree from any institution will not render an otherwise eligible player ineligible. The taking of minimal course loads for the sole purpose of retaining eligibility at an institution that the player would not otherwise be attending is prohibited. Determining whether this is taking place is at the sole discretion of the eligibility committee; players who do not meet the letter of the eligibility rules laid out here but who believe that their circumstances merit consideration should apply to this committee before attempting to register for any ACF tournaments. Sanctions for players discovered to be ineligible are discussed in rule C.8.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.1.</strong> The ACF eligibility committee consists of the head editors of ACF Fall, Regionals, and Nationals, or their designated proxies, who must be Full ACF members. This committee is the final authority on any question of eligibility. The following parties may petition the committee: any player regarding their own eligibility or the eligibility of any other player, any coach or other team adviser, or any director of an ACF tournament. The committee may be petitioned both before an ACF tournament and up to three weeks after the conclusion of the event. Players who question their own eligibility must petition the committee a reasonable amount of time before the tournament that they wish to play. If the committee retroactively declares a player ineligible, sanctions are available under Rule C.8. Once the committee rules a player eligible or ineligible, that decision will stand for the entire competition year unless the educational circumstances of the player in question change, in which case the committee may be asked to re-rule. Decisions of the committee require at least two of the three votes.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> Players may participate in tournaments held earlier in the academic year than their classes begin. Matches and tournament titles may be retroactively forfeited if the player does not eventually take a class or do the equivalent work described in rule C.2.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> Unless special dispensation is granted, players may participate for only one school in an academic year. If some legitimate situation arises in which a player might have good reason to play for a new school in a second tournament, such as transferring between semesters or a branch campus forming its own team, then the editors of the second tournament may choose to grant eligibility.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> In some circumstances, the editors of a collegiate ACF tournament will announce their own policy on when and how mixed teams or teams including non-students may participate. In the absence of any such announcement, teams may consist of individuals from only one school and may not include individuals enrolled at other schools or nonstudents.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.1.</strong> Players at graduate institutions which are affiliated with a state's university system in general but with no particular undergraduate college may choose to form their own team or to play for any school in the relevant university system, though they may not switch teams mid-year except as provided in rule C.4.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.2.</strong> Otherwise, players from schools which are branch campuses, members of the same university system, or otherwise formally affiliated with another school, may choose to play for an affiliated school if no team exists at their actual school and they are engaging in their only available option for participation. Players may not play for affiliated schools for the primary purpose of gaining a competitive advantage. Players may not switch from one affiliated school to another mid-season, but are encouraged to switch to their home campus if and when a team forms there as provided in rule C.4. The determination of whether a team exists at a given school or whether this rule is being abused to gain a competitive advantage is solely at the discretion of a tournament's editor.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>6.</strong> At the high school level, teams including students from more than one school may sometimes be permitted on an exhibition basis, as determined by the tournament director. Nonstudents—individuals who are not, were not, and are not planning to be secondary school students in the academic year that the tournament takes place—are never permitted to play in high school tournaments.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.</strong> Any accredited real-world educational institution that offers recognized degrees may participate in any collegiate-level ACF tournament. This includes all sorts of post-secondary institutions, such as service academies and community colleges, and also applies to high schools. Institutions with the word “online” in their names are not eligible. At high school tournaments, only high schools and, if in accordance with local traditions and the policy of the tournament director, middle schools, may participate.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.</strong> If a player is determined to be ineligible prior to an event, the sole penalty for that player will be disqualification from playing at that event on the team for which he is ineligible. He will still be allowed to play the event in question for any other team for which he meets the eligibility requirements of these rules, and his eligibility for future events will not be affected. A team which is discovered after an event to have used one or more ineligible players may be required to retroactively forfeit games involving that player and any titles dependent on the results of those particular games, but no other penalty will apply.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>9.</strong> An individual may play for only one team during a tournament; e.g., there is no switching from an “A” to “B” team during the day. Players must register as being on one team’s roster or another at the start of the tournament—even if a player, on a team with more than four players on its roster, does not actually play for the “A” team in some round, he is still on the “A” team’s roster for the entire day and cannot play for the “B” team in a later round.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>10.</strong> A team’s overall roster may consist of between one and six players, inclusive, over the course of the tournament. No more than four players may play at any one time. Substitutions during the game are governed by rule D.8.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.</strong> For collegiate tournaments which recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of "undergraduate" status, an "undergraduate" player is a player who did not receive a BA or equivalent or higher degree prior to the academic year in which the tournament is taking place, and meets EITHER or BOTH of the following conditions:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.1.</strong> The player graduated from high school in an academic year four or fewer years prior to the year in which the tournament is taking place</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.2.</strong> The player did not participate in any collegiate or open academic quizbowl tournaments before the fall semester of the academic year three years prior to the year in which the tournament is taking place</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.</strong> For collegiate tournaments that recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of "Division II" status, a "Division II" player is:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.1.</strong> At ACF Fall and Regionals, and any other collegiate tournament except ACF Nationals, any player who meets the definition of “undergraduate” and has never played ACF Nationals</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.2.</strong> At ACF Nationals, any freshman or sophomore player (measured by time in school, not by credits)</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>13.</strong> The tournament editors will determine what constitutes a "collegiate" or "academic" quizbowl tournament whenever the eligibility rules require such a distinction.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>D. Questions and Match Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> A tossup is a question for which competitors must signal in, using a lockout buzzer device, before answering. Conferring among team members on tossup questions, as defined in section E.5., is not allowed. A correct tossup answer is worth 10 points and, except in sudden-death tiebreaker situations, earns the reading of a bonus. An incorrect answer which is given before the reading of the question is complete and is the first buzz on the question loses 5 points. Incorrect answers after the other team has answered, or after the question is completely read, do not change the score.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> A bonus question is a series of question parts given to an entire team to answer. Conferring is allowed and encouraged. Usually, the captain submits the team’s answer for each part, though any player may give the team’s official answer by clearly directing an answer at the moderator; there is no need for the captain to formally “defer.” All bonuses are worth a total of 30 points and will consist of at least two parts with at least three total answers. Each bonus part must be answered after it is read.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> A match consists of twenty tossups and any bonuses earned by correctly answering tossups. The next unread bonus in the packet is read after each correctly answered tossup; the bonus numbers do not correspond to the tossup numbers.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> If a game is tied following the completion of the regular packet, the teams will play sudden-death tossups until a score change—a correct answer earning 10 points, or a -5 earned in the normal way—occurs to win or lose the game. Since incorrect answers on completed or already-negged tossups do not change the score, they do not, in and of themselves, lose the game.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> There are no timeouts in collegiate games. A short break, of no more than one minute, will be taken before tossup eleven. Before tossup eleven in all games, and before tossup nineteen in close games, the scorekeeper is encouraged to announce the score and to reconcile any discrepancies with players or spectators keeping an unofficial score.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>6.</strong> In collegiate tournaments, the game should not stop at periods other than halftime, except to accommodate emergencies or for other reasonable purposes that do not involve a team's attempt to gain a competitive advantage, at the moderator's discretion.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.</strong> As mentioned in rule A.5, high school tournaments should allow team members in the game to consult with coaches over whether to file a protest. This consultation must take place between the end of one tossup/bonus cycle and the start of the next tossup, and be limited to a reasonable amount of time. Under the same conditions, high school coaches may take one "timeout" per game of up to ninety seconds to advise their team members. However, these periods are not substitution opportunities; substitutions are allowed only at the times outlined in rule D.8. Attempts by a team to take a second such "timeout" in a game will simply be ignored, not penalized.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.</strong> Players on the team’s roster who are not in the game may be substituted in for another player before tossup 11, or before the first tiebreaker tossup is read if a game is tied after twenty tossup/bonus cycles, as described in rule D.4. There are no other substitution opportunities. A player who is substituted out of the game at halftime may re-enter as a substitute before a tiebreaker.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.1.</strong> A team or player who arrives while a game is already in progress may begin playing as soon as the next tossup starts, assuming the team does not already have four players active. This is not considered a “substitution.” If a team does start a game with four players, then a late-arriving player must wait for a designated substitution opportunity before he may replace another player. Unless otherwise stated by a tournament director, ACF’s policy on one team being late for a game, past the announced time at which a round is to start, is to begin reading to the team who is present and allow the opponent to start playing when they arrive, rather than to forfeit the game outright.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>E. Tossup Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> Players must buzz in before answering a tossup. Players are encouraged to answer as soon as the buzzer has locked out other players from ringing in. Thus, as soon as the buzzer systems sounds off and the moderator visually locates the participant who signals in first, that player should feel free to answer the tossup. There is no penalty for answering without being “recognized.”</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> A tossup remains alive for five seconds after it has been completed. Players who buzz as the moderator is calling time will be allowed to answer. If one team buzzes in incorrectly after the tossup has been completed, the five-second countdown begins again for the other team.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> Upon buzzing, the competitor has five seconds to begin giving his/her answer. After five seconds, the moderator will call time. Any answer which is not begun before the moderator calls time will not be considered. There will not be a prompt for an answer given if the player remains silent on a tossup. Failing to answer before time is called will be treated as a wrong answer. To avoid giving the other team extra clues as to what the answer is, the moderator should not explain close timing calls until after the tossup has been completed for both teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> After a player correctly answers a tossup, his team receives a bonus. The rules for bonus execution are in section F.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> Substantive conferring between team members is not allowed during the reading of a tossup question that the team is still eligible to answer. Substantive conferring refers to verbal, written or analogous communication among team members that can convey information pertinent to what the possible answer to the question is. Any instance of illegal conferring will be treated as a wrong answer; it will disqualify the conferring team from that tossup, and it will earn a neg-five if the other team has not already buzzed incorrectly and the question was not complete. Conferring calls are at the moderator’s discretion. Even if the team says an answer during or after an instance of illegal conferring, the other team will be permitted to hear the remainder of the tossup and buzz in and answer as normal, taking the other team’s utterance into account. However, if the moderator inadvertently reveals whether the answer given by the conferring team was correct, the conferring team may request that the tossup be thrown out and replaced with a substitute question read as normal to the opposing team, who will have the only opportunity to buzz in and answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>6.</strong> Nonsubstantive conferring, such as waving one’s hands or buzzer, issuing interjections of surprise, etc., will not be penalized, nor, generally, will it be acknowledged by the moderator at all.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.</strong> Players are responsible for monitoring their own buzzers throughout the match. Only the tossup that was just completed is subject to replay upon discovery of a buzzer system failure. Players may request buzzer checks at any time that a question is not in progress, in order to make sure the buzzer system is working.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.</strong> If a player believes his/her buzzer is not working during a tossup, a player may use physical or verbal cues directed at the game officials, such as shouting “buzz,” in order to buzz in on the tossup.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>9.</strong> Any person in the game room has the right to indicate during a tossup that the buzzer system was not cleared after the last buzz, preferably by stating the word “clear” to the moderator, and this shall never be construed as conferring or inappropriate behavior.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>10.</strong> If the moderator inadvertently reveals a tossup answer before either team has answered or after one team has given an incorrect answer, the question is thrown out. At the end of the game, if the missing points on the tossup plus the potential bonus potentially affect the outcome, appropriate replacement questions will be read, either to both teams if neither team had yet buzzed, or to one team if the other team had already answered incorrectly.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.</strong> If the substantive portion of a tossup has not yet begun—for example, if the moderator has only said “Next tossup,” or “Next tossup. It was…” and not read anything that could possibly indicate what the answer is—and a player buzzes in and claims to have accidentally pressed the button, the moderator will clear the system and proceed as if the buzz had not occurred. Any buzz after a substantive word has been read will be treated normally. Whether a substantive word has been read is a judgment call that is not protestable.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.</strong> Claims that the system is malfunctioning and buzzing in without being activated by a player will be evaluated by the moderator; if such a situation is deemed to exist, the just-read tossup will be thrown out and replaced, but no previous questions are subject to replay or protest.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>13.</strong> Answering when another player, whether on the same team or the opposing team, has buzzed in will be treated exactly like illegal conferring. This means that the nonbuzzing player who gives the answer earns a -5 for his team when applicable, and his team is locked out of answering that tossup. As in rule E.5, the moderator will call conferring only, without indicating whether the blurted answer is correct, and the other team’s members may consider the blurted answer if they buzz in later.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>F. Bonus Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> Teams have five seconds after each bonus part is read to give an answer, unless otherwise indicated by the question text. If no team member directs an answer towards the moderator within five seconds, or there are multiple conflicting answers being given, then the moderator will prompt the team captain for an official answer, which must be given immediately. If no answer is given at this time, the team receives no points on that bonus part.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> The moderator will rule on the correctness of an answer, and tell what the correct answer was if the answer given was wrong, after each individual bonus part rather than at the end of the entire bonus. There is no opportunity for the team which did not answer the tossup correctly to answer or receive points on the bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> If the moderator inadvertently reveals the answer to a bonus part or parts, then all compromised bonus parts will be thrown out. If the points thus removed could affect the outcome of the game, then a replacement bonus will be read, as described in rule F.4.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> For all situations in which a bonus is replaced, this procedure will apply: The team will play the entirety of the new bonus. The team will be able to earn a total number of bonus points up to the potential maximum if the error had not occurred, but not less than what they scored on the original bonus with the error included. For example, on a three-part, “for 10 points each” bonus, if a team misses part 1, gets part 2, and then is not able to answer part 3 due to moderator error, then that team can score no fewer than 10 points on their replacement bonus and no more than 20. Even if they actually get 0 parts right on the replacement, they receive 10 because they already got one part of the original bonus and should not be penalized out of those points on the replacement bonus. Even if they actually get all parts right on the replacement, they receive 20 , because they already missed one properly read part of the original bonus and should not get a second chance at those points on the replacement bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> At the end of the bonus, the moderator should clearly state the total number of points earned by the team and immediately reconcile any discrepancies over the point total.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>G. Acceptable Answers</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> The first answer given by a player on a tossup is the only answer that will be considered by the moderator. In this case, "giving an answer" involves completing at least one word of a potential answer. "Mozart—no Beethoven's piano sonatas" is not acceptable for "Beethoven's piano sonatas," but "Mo—Beethoven's piano sonatas" is (as long as the first word of the actual answer was begun before time expired). However, if the moderator judges that an otherwise allowable correction is done in response to a spectator or teammate's reaction to the initial answer, then the answer will be ruled wrong as conferring. If the player “corrects” a missed pronunciation or gives a second answer, the moderator will ignore the second answer and rule only that the first answer given was correct or incorrect. To avoid giving the other team extra clues as to what the answer is, the moderator should not explain that he ignored the second answer until after the tossup has been completed for both teams. On bonuses, this rule will directly apply only when a captain is answering a bonus after a five-second prompt; moderators may ask the captain to clarify what the team’s answer is in other situations.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> Two or more pieces of related information of different types, such as author/book, president/organization, or actor/role, but not two authors, three books, etc., may be given and treated as one answer. If any part contains the answer being sought, and the items are correctly related, the answer shall be ruled correct. If the parts are not related, or neither is the answer being sought, the answer shall be ruled incorrect. For examples, “Robert Jordan, For Whom the Bell Tolls” is correct if the answer being sought is Robert Jordan or For Whom the Bell Tolls but not if the answer is “Ernest Hemingway.” “Frederic Henry, For Whom the Bell Tolls” is never acceptable regardless of what the answer being sought is, since Frederic Henry is not in For Whom the Bell Tolls.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> When the title of a work not originally written in English is the answer, titles in the original language are generally provided in the packet. Those titles in the original language are acceptable, as are idiomatic or literal English translations and any titles under which a translation of the work has been published in English. Translations into languages that are neither the original language nor English are generally not acceptable. Thus, for Marcel Proust’s series “À la recherche du temps perdu,” that original French title is acceptable, the literal translation “In Search of Lost Time” is acceptable, and the title “Remembrance of Things Past” is acceptable because the series was published under that name in English; however, "En búsqueda del tiempo perdido" is not acceptable, since Spanish is not the original language of the series. Ambiguities across languages will normally be resolved in favor of the player; for example, “A Dog’s Heart,” “Heart of a Dog,” “The Heart of a Dog,” and “The Heart of the Dog” are all acceptable for Mikhail Bulgakov’s Sobace serdtse, as the player is not expected to figure out whether or how to supply articles that do not exist in Russian. However, players will not receive credit for a correct answer when making implausible translations: “The Heart Inside the Dog” is never acceptable, since there is no correct way to translate the Russian title in that way. Since moderators and tournament directors cannot be expected to be familiar with the intricacies of every foreign language, players are encouraged to give non-esoteric or traditional English translations, or the original-language title, in order to avoid complicated protests over translated answers.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> For names from cultures in which the family name precedes the given name, such as Chinese or Japanese names, the family name is necessary to receive credit for a correct response. The player can give either the native order of naming, with family name first, or the Anglicized order, with family name last, as an acceptable answer. An answer of the given name only will not be accepted or prompted, unless the person is widely known by a pseudonym consisting of his given name, which is acceptable under rule G.16.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.1.</strong> Compound last names must be given in their entirety, and a partial last name will not be prompted. E.g., " García Márquez" and "van Buren" are the required parts of the answer for Gabriel García Márquez and Martin van Buren, and answers such as "Marquez" or "Buren" are outright incorrect. It is acceptable to give a partial last name for people with formally compound last names when those people are usually referred to by a part of their name—e.g., "Pablo Picasso" is acceptable for "Pablo Ruiz y Picasso."</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> In most contexts, the initial two digits of dates in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries may be omitted: “63” is acceptable for an answer of 1963, but not for 1763. Similarly, it is not usually necessary to identify dates as AD/CE versus BC/BCE. Exceptions to this rule will arise on a common-sense basis from the context of the question and will be reflected in the underlining and other moderator instructions in the packet. For example, in a question which first mentions that a painter finished a particular work in 1829 and then asks when he completed another work, it is understood by common sense that an answer of "38" can only refer to "1838," so that answer will be accepted if "1838" is correct.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>6.</strong> Leading articles in titles may be omitted in most cases; e.g., “Scarlet Letter” is acceptable for The Scarlet Letter. Incorrect leading articles, including any leading articles supplied when the title actually has no leading article, will result in the answer being ruled wrong; e.g.. “A Scarlet Letter” and “The Great Expectations” are unacceptable. Full titles with leading articles are required when omitting the article may cause confusion with another work that might reasonably be expected to be an answer; e.g, “Invisible Man” is never acceptable for H.G. Wells’s The Invisible Man since Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison is a plausible answer. This rule may not always apply to translated titles; see rule G.3 for details. The definite article “the” may be added before musical works, religious texts, and other types of titles often referred to in such a manner, without rendering the answer wrong.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.</strong> Very commonly used short forms of lengthy titles may be given instead of the complete title, e.g. The Wealth of Nations is acceptable for An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations. Subtitles are never required; e.g., Pericles is always acceptable for Pericles, Prince of Tyre. In other cases, partial titles will not be accepted or prompted.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.</strong> Commonly used abbreviations such as “J.F.K.” may be given as answers. When the abbreviation is used as a tossup clue, it will be acceptable as an answer until it is read as part of the text of the question. Similarly, chemical formulae, the postal abbreviations for states, and so forth will be accepted unless they have already been mentioned in the question at the point of answering. In some cases, the question text may specifically call for the expanded answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>9.</strong> The moderator may ask for any answer to be repeated if he/she did not hear it clearly. Additionally, the moderator will prompt for a more specific answer when instructed by the packet. On a tossup, the answer must be immediate; on a bonus, the team may take two seconds to confer again. If the player or team responds with a more specific answer that is still not as specific as required, the moderator may prompt again and continue to do so as long as the team continues to move toward the answer required.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>10.</strong> Embellishment of answers will be disregarded unless it renders the answer incorrect. Hesitation markers around answers ("uh…uh…G. Stanley Hall?"), the couching of answers in sentences or commentary of any kind ("Could this possibly be The Abduction from the Seraglio, which I think is awesome?") or the player forgetting what game he is playing ("Who is Vita Sackille-West?") will never render an answer incorrect. However, the player must give the first word of the actual content of the answer before the time limit expires, and cannot use filler words to try to gain extra time.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.</strong> If a moderator asks for spelling to distinguish between multiple answers, only letters which are essential to making the distinction need be correct. E.g, a player who spells out “M-O-N-A-Y” for Claude Monet will be ruled correct, since the moderator only wishes to distinguish between Claude Monet and Edouard Manet, rather than test the player’s spelling skill. In all cases, diacritical marks may be ignored.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.</strong> Players are not expected to know the exact pronunciation of every answer. Therefore, any reasonable attempt at pronouncing an answer will either be ruled correct or result in a prompt for spelling (to be evaluated under rule G.11), and any answer with the correct consonant sounds in the correct order will be accepted. For example, “Stend-HALE” or “STOON-dahl” are correct for Stendhal; “STED-nahl” or “STINK-dahl” are not. Within reasonable accommodations for those with speech impediments or heavy accents, which preferably are disclosed before the start of the game, moderators have complete discretion to judge or further prompt the pronunciation of a response, and such rulings are not protestable</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>13.</strong> Acceptable answers for fictional characters include the personal or first name, family name, nickname appearing in the work, or whole name, as long as such information is sufficient to uniquely identify the character within the fictional universe and the space of reasonable answers. Questions may sometimes ask for specific forms of character names.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>14.</strong> For American appellate court cases, either party name is acceptable unless one party is “the United States” or a particular state, in which case the other party name must be given. E.g., either “Gibbons” or “Ogden” is sufficient for Gibbons v. Ogden, but “Miranda” is required for Miranda v. Arizona, and an answer of “Arizona” will not be accepted or prompted. When giving the full name of the case, any order of party names is acceptable; e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden is interchangeable with Ogden v. Gibbons. Cases in which both the party names are names of states or “the United States” will require both party names, in either order, as the answer. Widely known informal nicknames, such as “The Sick Chicken Case,” are acceptable unless otherwise indicated in the question. Players are discouraged from using less common nicknames. Docket numbers or other methods of referring to court cases are generally not acceptable. The method of identifying a non-American court case will be given in the question and/or will normally reflect the common informal ways of referring to cases in the relevant jurisdiction.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>15.</strong> On questions which require multiple answers, the answers must be given in one sequence without any unnatural pause. Answers given after such a pause will be disregarded.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>16.</strong> The maiden names of women better known by their married names and the real names of people better known by their pseudonyms are always acceptable, and vice versa.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>17.</strong> For individuals who share a last name with another person who may be reasonably expected to be an answer in the same general category, some further form of identification may be required, at the discretion of the packet editors. In such cases, usually the first initial of the person's first name will be underlined. Unlike in the situation of people with identical first and last names, the person's actual first initial or name will usually be required. For example, answering "Shelley" will always result in a prompt for either Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley or Percy Bysshe Shelley, since both are figures from the same period of English literature and are thus considered part of the same general category. Giving either "M. Shelley" or "P. Shelley" is all that is needed to earn credit for a correct response. However, saying "Shelley the male" or "Shelley the wife" is not an acceptable answer to that prompt. As in all situations, commonly used pseudonyms and nicknames are acceptable in this situation.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>18.</strong> For individuals who share both a first and last name with another person who may be reasonably expected to be an answer in the same general category, some further form of identification may be required, at the discretion of the packet editors. In such cases, this identification need only be enough to distinguish the correct answer from the plausible incorrect answer, and need not be formal or complete. For example, “Richard H. Lee” or “Richard Lee from the eighteenth century” is enough to distinguish the Continental Congress member Richard Henry Lee from the Richard Lee who founded the Lee family in Virginia; answering “Richard Lee” for either will earn a prompt. On a question looking for the 43rd U.S. President, “George Bush” will earn a prompt in order to distinguish from the 41st president. At that point, “George W. Bush,” “the second George Bush,” “George Bush the younger” or similar such answers are all acceptable, since the player needs only distinguish the correct answer from the incorrect one, and does not need to demonstrate knowledge of George Walker Bush’s full name.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>19.</strong> Analogous figures from other myth systems will not normally be accepted when the question has given a proper name from a particular myth system; equivalent Babylonian names cannot be given for a question with only Sumerian names as clues, equivalent Roman names cannot be given for a question with only Greek names as clues, etc. No prompt will be given in such situations. However, when a mix of traditions is reflected in the names used as clues, or when no proper name has been given at the point of answering, any equivalent name for a mythological figure is acceptable.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>H. Protests</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> A protest may be made by any team member who is in the game at the time of the issue in question.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> The procedure for making a protest is simply to indicate verbally to the moderator that one wishes to protest a ruling; saying the word “protest” will suffice. Protests on a tossup or bonus must be made sometime before the next tossup is read, or immediately after the game is complete if there is a protest on tossup 20, the associated bonus, or a tiebreaker tossup. Any discussion that needs to occur within the game room should happen after the end of the tossup/bonus cycle, rather than while a question is still live.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> The other team may concede the protest, in which case the protest is considered resolved in favor of the protesting team. If the other team does not concede, the moderator may consult with any other tournament staff in the room and make a ruling. If the moderator does not feel competent to rule on the issue at hand or if the protesting team is not satisfied with the moderator’s ruling, then the protest becomes at issue for tournament staff, and will be resolved under the procedure described in rules H.6 through H.11.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> The following potential errors, and only the following, are protestable:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.1.</strong> The answer in the packet is wrong for the question and the protesting player/team gave the correct answer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.2.</strong> The question or answer was ambiguous, so the answer given by the player should be accepted since it fits all the clues given in the entire question text, or all the clues up to a significantly deep point in the question.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.3.</strong> The player gave a correct alternate name for the answer that was not included in the list of acceptable answers to the question.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.4.</strong> More information was required than was reasonable to identify the answer, and the protesting player gave sufficient information to identify the answer but not as much as the packet required and was ruled incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.5.</strong> Two or more clues within the question uniquely describe different answers, or one clue definitely does not refer to the same answer as the other clues—hence, there is no correct answer to the question. This protest may be lodged by either team at the end of a question converted by neither team or by the team that did not get the question after a question is converted by one team. However, if this situation arises on a tossup that the other team converted before the first clue creating a contradiction was read, there may be no protest because the team that missed the question was not misled.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.6.</strong> The protesting team’s opponent received credit for an incorrect answer through either packet or moderator error.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> Nothing else is protestable, including but not limited to: judgment calls of any kind such as calling time, whether a tossup had begun before an accidental buzz as described in E.11, whether verbal conferring occurred, or the failure of the question to require a prompt on an opposing team’s answer.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.1.</strong> Formal protests relying solely on a player’s dispute with a moderator over what the moderator heard are also prohibited. However, if and only if the opposing team concedes the moderator's error in discerning the given answer, the moderator will re-evaluate the actually given answer.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>6.</strong> The tournament director has ultimate authority to rule on all live protests but may delegate this authority to another individual or committee for the duration of the tournament or on a case-by-case basis.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.</strong> A live protest whose upholding could change the outcome of the game will always be ruled upon. In the event that such a protest is upheld, the following procedures will be followed depending on the circumstances that produced the protest:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.1.</strong> For a team claiming that the answer they gave to a tossup was correct but ruled incorrect by the packet or moderator under appropriate sections in rule H.4: If the other team subsequently converted the tossup, their tossup points, and their bonus points earned pursuant to that tossup, will be removed. The tossup points will be given to the team whose protest was upheld and their neg removed. The protesting team will be reseated and play a bonus, if necessary.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.2.</strong> For a team claiming that the answer they gave to a bonus was correct but ruled wrong by the packet or moderator under appropriate sections in rule H.4: they will receive the points for the bonus answer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.3.</strong> For a team seeking the replacement of a tossup under rule H.4: If the other team subsequently converted the tossup, their tossup points, and their bonus points earned pursuant to that tossup, will be removed. The teams will be reseated and a new tossup will be read. If the other team gets the tossup right, they will get the tossup points as well as the points earned on the original bonus. If the protesting team gets the tossup right, they will get the tossup points and be read a new bonus.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.4.</strong> For a team seeking replacement of a bonus part under rule H.4: The protesting team will be reseated and a new bonus will be read as described in rule F.4.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.5.</strong> For a team protesting an improperly accepted tossup answer under rule H.4.6: The opponent’s tossup points and any points on the associated bonus will be removed. If the protesting team had already answered the tossup incorrectly and has no other protest, then this ends the resolution of the protest. If they had not yet buzzed in, the protesting team will be reseated and read a replacement tossup, for their team only, which they may buzz on and answer normally. If they convert the tossup, a bonus will be read.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>7.6.</strong> For a team protesting an improperly accepted bonus answer under rule H.4.6: The opponent’s points will be removed.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>8.</strong> If the resolution of any protest as above creates a tie, then the teams will play a tiebreaker under the normal procedure as described in rule D.4. The tiebreaker will only be played if and after the protest creating the tie is upheld, and should not be played beforehand on any contingency basis.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>9.</strong> Before making a final ruling on a protest, the tournament director or his/her designated officer or committee will make every reasonable effort to consult reliable academic resources in order to help determine the factual accuracy of the complaint. Teams involved in the protest may offer suggestions as to where to find relevant information if this is done in a polite and quick manner.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>10.</strong> If the tournament director determines that a team is lodging frivolous or abusive protests, he will warn the team for inappropriate conduct under rule B.3 and may take further action if the behavior continues.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>11.</strong> The general principle at work in ruling on protests and in enforcing all rules, and especially to be kept in mind in deciding how to proceed in areas where the rules are unclear, is to reward knowledge and to uphold common practice of past independent quizbowl tournaments. Moderators and tournament directors should not go out of their way to find a reason to rule an answer wrong, and the relationship among teams and between teams and the staff should be cordial and in the spirit of academic pursuit.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>12.</strong> The improper application of rules by the moderator, to the degree that it affects the competitive play of the game, is outside the realm of "protests." Only in this situation do teams have the right to leave the game room and ask the tournament director to intervene immediately, rather than waiting until the game is finished. Tournament directors should handle such a situation with the goal of restoring the game to the point where it would be had the rules been applied properly; in extreme cases, this may mean throwing out and replacing all affected questions, or restarting the entire game. Tournament directors are encouraged to be sure their moderators are familiar with the rules in order to avoid such situations.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>I. Tournament formats and tiebreakers for standings</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.</strong> When two or more teams have the same record and are competing for fewer spots available in the next phase of the tournament than there are teams involved in the tie, the tournament director should break ties based on play-in games on full or half packets when time constraints and available packets permit, using rules I.1.1 and I.1.2 to determine how to seed the play-in games. When this is not feasible, the tournament director should use either PPG or bonus conversion to break the tie directly, as determined by rules I.1.1 and I.1.2. The head-to-head results of previous matches should not be used to break ties at any time.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.1.</strong> If the teams have played the same set of opponents throughout the day, as in a round-robin format, points per game should be used to break ties or to seed for play-in games.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>1.2.</strong> If the teams have not played the same set of opponents throughout the day, such as when comparing teams from different preliminary pools in a high school tournament for “wild-card” spots in a single-elimination playoff, bonus conversion should be used to break ties or to seed for play-in games, in order to isolate the teams’ performances from the different sets of opponents played.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>2.</strong> High school tournaments should use whatever format is appropriate for the field size, staff availability, and local traditions. It is suggested that all teams be offered the opportunity to play at least seven meaningful games, with “meaningful games” being defined as games that may impact a team’s final placement in the tournament. Formats which produce a top-to-bottom ranking of all teams are encouraged.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.</strong> For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals, the editors may choose to issue mandatory formats for each potential field size, and exceptions should be negotiated directly with the editors. In the absence of such guidelines, and for all other collegiate tournaments, the only absolute requirements for collegiate formats are as follows:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.1.</strong> The tiebreaker procedures described in rule I.1 should be followed, and the finals format described in rule I.5 should be used.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.2.</strong> Single-elimination playoffs, double-elimination playoffs, and playoff formats fundamentally identical to either should not be used.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>3.3.</strong> When using a full round-robin format followed by a split into playoff brackets for rematches, preliminary records should carry over for the calculation of the final standings. When using a multi-bracket preliminary format followed by rebracketing into new divisions for round-robin playoffs, preliminary records should not carry over. When using a multi-bracket preliminary format followed by rebracketing into new divisions for crossover playoffs, only the results of games against other teams in the same playoff division should carry over.</span></p>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>4.</strong> In the absence of mandated formats from editors, tournament directors should endeavor to offer teams as many meaningful games as possible given packet, staff, and time constraints. A minimum number of ten meaningful games is usually considered acceptable. Formats which produce a top-to-bottom ranking of all teams are encouraged.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;"><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>5.</strong> The ACF-format finals procedure for collegiate tournaments requires that a team which has cleared the field or playoff bracket by two or more games in the standings wins the tournament outright. When two teams are tied, they play a one-game final. When a team is exactly one game ahead of the second-place team, a weighted best-of-three final occurs, with the team that has the better record needing to win only one game to take the championship, but the trailing team needing to win two games in a row. If there are ties for the second-place spot in such a situation, or ties of three or more teams for first place, the tournament director should consult rule I.1 to set up the appropriate tiebreaker</span>s and eliminate all but two teams, then play those two teams in the appropriate finals format.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF Fall is still currently seeking a host for the Southeast site. Hosting is a good way to cut down on travel costs, raise money, and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you have any interest in hosting or questions about it, please refer first to the official <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/hosting-guidelines/2011-2012/">ACF Hosting Guidelines</a>, and then e-mail Carsten Gehring at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The deadline for bids is September 17, 2011. Bids will not be accepted after that point, and earlier bids will receive priority over later bids, all else being equal.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> As per the ACF submission rules, any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2010 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2011-2012. This includes ACF Fall. As of last year, high school players are now included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams. Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit packets to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a> and use “ACF Fall 2011: [Team Name]” in the subject line. This year’s submission schedule is:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet submitted before 11:59 PM eastern time on:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 11, 2011: -$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 25, 2011: -$25 (-$50 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 9, 2011: No penalty (-$25 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 16, 2011: +$25</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 23, 2011: +$50</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Please take a moment to review the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#formatting">ACF Packet Guidelines on formatting</a> to make sure you format your packet correctly.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. Teams caught plagiarizing will be subject to large fines and possibly a thread not dissimilar to <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6868&amp;start=0">this one</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Writing specific types of forbidden questions: Types of questions prohibited at ACF events include spelling questions, binary matching bonuses, and 5-10-15 bonuses.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please see the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">additional packet penalties section</a> for more info.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Friendly Reminders</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Please refer to the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Guidelines</a> document for more detailed explanations of packet submission and fee-related information.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets or talk about their contents.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2011 is the same as it has been for the past four years, such as can be seen in ACF Fall 2009 and ACF Fall 2010. These tournaments can be found on <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a>. Remember above all that the tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before, in both your answerlines and your selection of clues. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please let Carsten know at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a>.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Subash Maddipoti's Tips on Question Writing</title>
  <link>http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/</link>
  <pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2012 17:07:54 +0000</pubDate>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Editor's note: Quizbowl luminary and ACF member emeritus Subash Maddipoti  wrote this guideline in the early 2000s as a quick guideline for writers. Most of it remains excellent advice, but ACF has given it a modern gloss to reflect developments since its writing. Where the substance of content was changed, editor's remarks are indicated in [brackets].</em>

I'd like to just point to some recurring problems I've seen in questions - problems that I hope to help teams address before they submit their packets.

<strong>1. Extended and vague stylistic references to a writer, painter, musician, philosopher, or other figures in the humanities are unnecessary and often frustrating to those listening to the question, particularly when they come early in the question.</strong>

<em>Example:</em> "His intermittent surrealist depictions and use of vivid color belied the realism and monochromatic pigments that the public associated with him."

<em>Why this is bad:</em> Unless you have incredible art knowledge, you have no way of knowing that this is uniquely identifying (and even then you can't be sure). These sentences cause many players to drone the question out, slow down the flow of the packet, and are usually a clear indication that the information was plagiarized from a reference source (paraphrase to your heart's content). Even if you can determine with confidence that it is a unique description, you should never begin the question with it, as you've most likely created an immediate buzzer race.

<em>What you can do about it:</em> Keep stylistic descriptions succinct and use them only if you're sure that they bring important and unique information to the question.

<strong>2. Beginning a tossup on a person with a quote about that person is often a bad idea.</strong>

<em>Example:</em> When Emerson asked this man, "How many men possessed of your views, who will remain after you, are going to put them in practice?" he candidly replied, "Not one."

<em>Why this is bad:</em> These quotes usually exemplify the frequent problems of vague clues and unnecessary filler alluded to above. If it's a good quote, then it's probably a well-known quote and makes a bad lead-in. If it's a quote that you know is not well-known, then what's the point - use something more concrete. [Quotes are sometimes appropriate clues, but typically only if they are notable enough to comprise a clue in the middle of the question that more players will be buzzing off of. Testing for knowledge of random Bartlett's reading in the lead-in is almost never appropriate, and ACF editors will almost certainly delete such clues.]

Note that your use of a clue with a quote that also dicusses stylistic details is anathema and will result in the wrath of both [diminutive former Nuggets point guard] Earl Boykins and myself.

<em>What you can do about it:</em> Don't use quotes as lead-ins.

<strong>3. Beginning a tossup on an individual with [titles, including] that individual's first or last work should be done with caution and should be avoided in the majority of [questions on people].</strong>

<em>Example:</em> "His first novel <em>Cup of Gold</em> . . . "

<em>Why this is bad:</em> Players with no knowledge of John Steinbeck's body of work will be able to buzz in right away with simple list knowledge. [First works are particularly familiar to many players because old packets often mention them, so they should be avoided especially. But in general, starting with a title before describing a work rewards title-author binary knowledge over more in-depth knowledge of important works, so don't do it.]

<em>What you can do about it:</em> [Follow this simple rule: describe before you name. The more buzzable the name is, the more detailed the description should be. Your descriptions should always be specific, concrete, and buzzable. For very famous works that many players are sure to be familiar with, it's of paramount importance to describe the work well before naming it, because the name will likely end the question in most rooms.]

<strong>4. Reorder your clues when describing characters in a work and their occupation or significance, i.e. when you're using appositives.</strong>

<em>Example:</em> "Its protagonist Clym Yeobright, a former diamond merchant in Paris, loses his eyesight."

<em>Why this is bad:</em> The use of appositives, however grammatically correct and appropriate to the smooth flow of a tossup, often damages the pyramidality of a tossup. Someone who only has quizbowl knowledge about <em>Return of the Native</em> is just as likely to buzz after the first four words of that clue as someone who has read the novel. [This is analogous to the above problem with titles; just like you shouldn't say <em>Cup of Gold</em> without telling players what <em>Cup of Gold </em>is, you shouldn't say "Clym Yeobright" without first describing him to players so that the person with the best Yeobright knowledge wins out over someone who simply knows the name.]

<em>What you can do about it:</em> Reorder your clues - Begin with your noun phrase or noun instead of the noun it renames. For example: "The former diamond merchant in Paris who is now losing his eyesight is this novel's protagonist, Clym Yeobright." [In other words, describe before you name.

Also keep in mind that descriptions need not come right before the names of the things they describe; you can always put the sentence "This novel's protagonist is a former diamond merchant who is losing his eyesight." ahead of the sentence "This novel's protagonist is Clym Yeobright." if the two pieces of information diverge in notability or don't flow well together.]

<strong>5. Beginning science tossups with the inventors or formulators of the apparatus or concept being asked about is almost always not a good idea. On a related note, a tossup on a concept that primarily discusses its formulator is not really a substantive tossup.</strong>

<em>Examples:</em> "Cornell, Ketterle, and Wieman won a Nobel for achieving it . . ." or "Its formulator, younger brother of physicist Karl, became head of the physics department at Washington University in St. Louis in 1920."

<em>Why these are bad:</em> Someone who knows nothing about the Bose-Einstein condensate (and I mean nothing) would be able to buzz on that first lead-in. The second lead-in, purportedly a tossup on the Compton effect, tells us nothing about the effect and only gives us some data on Arthur Compton. ***

<em>What you can do about it:</em> Get facts on the Bose-Einstein condensate and Compton effect and try to organize them to the best of your ability from most obscure to most well-known. [With the exception of a handful of science biography questions that appear in the "other science" distribution, quizbowl in general has moved away from asking about the lives of scientists and instead focuses on meaty descriptions of the science itself. While there are occasionally tossups on people, such as Compton, these questions focus on the science and leave the biography out.]

<strong>6. When trying to assess the appropriate difficulty level for a tossup answer, consult [old packets at the difficulty level for which you are writing]. If your answer has not come up AT LEAST twice as a prior tossup or [easy] bonus answer, then you should almost certainly not be writing a tossup with said answer.</strong>

<em>Examples:</em> It [may be difficult for someone who has] read Balzac in an freshman or sophomore class but [is] new to the game to discern that a tossup on <em>Pere Goriot</em> or <em>Cousine Bette</em> is greatly preferable to a tossup on <em>Lost Illusions</em> or <em>The Wild Ass's Skin </em>[at the Regionals level. At the Fall level, a tossup on Balzac is appropriate, but any tossup on a work (except perhaps <em>The Human Comedy</em> in general) is likely too hard. At Nationals, all of these answers may be appropriate.]

[<em>Why this is bad: </em>All ACF tournaments have different difficulties and answerability goals. New writers often write tossups that are too hard for the level that's appropriate.

<em>What you can do about it:</em> Go to the archive and look for your answer in similar-difficulty packets. If you're not sure how to do this, consult an experienced teammate (make sure they're not playing the tournament you're writing for on another team, though). If all else fails, write on something you know is easy enough for the level, using harder clues if you want (for example, if you're just dying to write a tossup on a work, but you're not sure if the work is too hard for the level, why not write it on the creator of the work, using mostly clues about that work in the tossup?).

Finally, there are official resources you can turn to. First, ACF has instituted its writer <a title="Writer Feedback" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/writer-feedback/">feedback program</a>; don't hesitate to take advantage of this great resource, because we can advise you on the difficulty of your questions and suggest many other changes to help you improve as a writer. Second, you should have no qualms consulting the tournament's head editor with questions (about difficulty or anything else) before submitting your packet. They're glad to help, especially if it results in more good questions.]

<strong>7. [N]ever write a tossup on a subject that is only gettable by a "cutesy" or "sounds like" or [an unrelated] "shares its name with" type giveaway.</strong>

<em>Example:</em> "After ordination as an Anglican priest in 1883, this historian moved to Europe to pursue another profession. As an Alpinist he made 1,750 ascents by 1900, including the first winter ascent of the Jungfrau. For 10 points, name this American mountaineer, who shares his surname with our 30th president"

<em>Why this is bad:</em> This question is bad for many reasons, but illustrates the fundamental point I am trying to make. I don't mean to belittle the historical importance of William Coolidge, but I would suspect that 99% of the players would not be able to answer this question until the last two words. These questions simply make players angry, create the wrong kind of buzzer race, and, in my opinion, show a total lack of regard on the part of the question writer. [Additionally, the knowledge of "who the 30th president is" has nothing to do with the knowledge of "who William Coolidge is," which is what this question purports to test. If the answer is too hard for players to get without an unrelated or cutesy giveaway, don't write on it.]

<em>What to do about it:</em> Don't write questions like this. If the only clue you can find about an individual or thing is its similarity to another more well-known thing, then it's not tossup-worthy. If you still feel the need to include it in a question, then use it as a lead-in.

<em>A good example:</em> A tossup on the English architect John Nash would be a bad idea, but [using John Nash as a clue, perhaps in an architecture tossup on "London," or as the hard part to a bonus, might be more appropriate. Additionally, ACF's "other academic" distribution might be the place for a cross-disciplinary question on various people named "Nash" or "John Nash" (for example, the mathematician and the architect). These questions are hard to do well, but they can be interesting.

Additionally, the use of <em>related</em> giveaways may sometimes be a good idea. For example, a tossup on Purkinje cells might mention that their namesake also discovered electricity-conducting fibers in the heart. This still requires substantial biology knowledge to receive ten points, so it may be appropriate to increase conversion. A tossup on Purkinje whose first half is about the cells and whose second half is about the fibers is probably preferable at most difficulty levels, however.]

<strong>8. [Don't ignore the fact that] distribution diversity requirements apply over every aspect of your packet.</strong>

<em>Why this is bad:</em> A packet with tossups on <em>King Lear</em>, <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, <em>Travesties</em>, <em>Heartbreak House</em>, and <em>The Alchemist</em> (all British drama) is as equally bad as a packet with tossups on the Vichy government, treaty of Verdun, Francis I, and the Estates-General (all French history). For the same reason, a packet with a science tossup on Eratosthenes (science biography is bad), a philosophy tossup on Thales, a history tossup on Philip of Macedon, and a literature tossup on <em>The Thebaid</em> is unacceptable. Just because you don't repeat genre, convention, race, nationality, or format within a category, you do not have license to repeat them across categories.

[<em>What to do about it: </em>Adhere to ACF's subdistribution breakdowns, but also make sure to maintain cross-category diversity. Stuffing your packet with avant-garde 20th century lit, music, and painting is just as problematic for editors as writing three British history tossups, so don't do it!]

<strong>9. Don't write your questions with the purpose of having them read for the benefit or any indvidual player.</strong>

<em>Example:</em> I know that Team X is obsessed with the work of David Hockney, so I'm going to write this wonderful tossup on <em>A Bigger Splash</em>, or I know that Bill Williamson is a big fan of Schumann, so I'll write this tossup on <em>Kreisleriana</em>.

<em>Why this is bad:</em> (I'm sure I don't have to say, but . . .) Most importantly, these questions, even if they are written with the strictest pyramidality, show a fundamental favoritism that should absolutely be avoided. As a consequence, they also end up being way too difficult, as both of the above two examples would be for Regionals (and Nationals as well). I don't know how frequently this happens, but I know that I have been guilty of it in the past. If you catch yourself doing this, please correct it right away, as it's completely unfair to the other teams.

<strong>10. If you're unsure about difficulty or characterization of a subject within categories (or anything about packets), consult [an experienced teammate or the editors of the tournament].</strong>

Generally, these decisions are pretty subjective and will vary depending on the editor, but for each year the head editor's say is final. So for example if you're wondering whether your tossup on <em>The Chocolate War</em>, or <em>Flatland</em>, or <em>The Time Machine</em> is considered literature (for the purposes of your packet), then please ask. I would tell you the latter two are, but the <em>The Chocolate War</em> is not. If you asked me why, then I would respond: in general sci-fi and children's lit do not satisfy your literature quota, but certain novels can transcend their genre. I would argue that <em>Flatland</em> and <em>The Time Machine</em> do and <em>The Chocolate War</em> does not. Feel free to debate this point to your heart's content, but if you are unsure please ask and save me the trouble of possibly having to replace a question and give you the luxury of possibly having another one of your questions heard.

  <title>ACF Nationals 2012</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Logistical information</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF Nationals this year will be held at the University of Maryland in colorful College Park, Maryland. The tournament will last all day on Saturday, April 21 and conclude on the morning of Sunday, April 22.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be the head editor of this tournament and will post information on packet submission shortly.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Matt Weiner will be Tournament Director. Nationals will be a fully staffed, efficiently run tournament with a sensible format that remembers to award the Undergraduate and Division II trophies.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Information on hotels and such is to follow. If you have any questions about the logistics of ACF Nationals that you need answered right now, feel free to post here or e-mail Matt Weiner at mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com. We're looking forward to a healthy field and a great event.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be taking registrations for the tournament, so if you want to sign up before you hand your packet in, contact him at jonathan.magin@gmail.com.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet submission, eligibility, and fee schedule</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Guidelines for who is eligible to play ACF tournaments and packet submission can be found here: <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Fee schedule:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Base fee: $220</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$100 discount: January 23</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$50 discount: February 6</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$25 discount: February 20</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> No penalty: March 6</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$25 penalty: March 13</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$50 penalty: March 20</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">NOTE: No packets will be accepted later than two weeks before the tournament!</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF cannot make this any clearer: After the $50 deadline, you will owe the editors $10/day; if you cannot turn in a packet more than two weeks in advance of ACF Nationals, you will not be playing ACF Nationals. This is a hard and fast deadline and there will be no exceptions.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This year, ACF also announces a 50 dollar discount for teams who write at least 20/20 that doesn’t need any major editing and submit their packet by the no penalty deadline. By major editing, we mean things like having to change many of the clues and/or answerlines and having to fix many grammatical errors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We would much rather give out lots of hefty discounts for excellent early packets than rake in money for late ones, so please take advantage of them.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Distribution:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Literature: This includes 1/1 American, 1/1 British, 1/1 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre (for instance, please don’t submit 5/5 on French literature or 5/5 poetry).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 History: This includes 1/1 American, 2/2 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please make sure that your questions aren’t all from the same time period or place and aren’t all one type of history (for instance, try not to submit 5/5 political history or 5/5 military history).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Science: This includes 1/1 Biology, 1/1 Chemistry, 1/1 Physics, and 2/2 Other Science (including areas like Astronomy, Earth Science, Math, and Computer Science). Please don’t write two questions about the same scientific subdistribution.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 Arts: This includes 1/1 Painting, 1/1 Classical Music, and 1/1 Other (including Architecture, Sculpture, Opera, Jazz, Ballet/Dance, Art Film, and Photography). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 RMP: This includes 1/1 Religion, 1/1 Mythology, and 1/1 Philosophy. Please do not write both religion questions on the same religion or both mythology questions on the same myth system.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Social Science: This includes Psychology, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, and Social Criticism. Please write your tossup and bonus on different areas of social science.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Geography/Current Events: These questions should be about different parts of the world. Geography questions that incorporate cultural and environmental clues instead of purely discussing physical features are particularly welcome.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Other Academic: This includes questions from every preceding category, as well as answers that don’t quite fit into any of the preceding categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Keep in mind that ACF Nationals does not have trash; if you submit any trash questions, they will simply be sent back.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To reiterate, please vary the distribution of your questions. Last year, we had teams submit packets with both chemistry questions about the same narrow area, to present one example, and it would prevent many headaches if you make sure your questions are reasonably distributed. Also, please remember that while the goal of ACF Nationals is to determine the best team in the nation, writing primarily about extremely difficult topics is not the best way to achieve this, so please try to keep your fellow players in mind while choosing your answer lines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This announcement comes with ample time for everyone to start writing their Nationals packets and submit them as early as possible. We want to give you every opportunity to save money on this fantastic event and save us the trouble of having to edit a bunch of packets at the last minute. You should avail yourself of this chance posthaste.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All packets should be sent to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:jonathan.magin@gmail.com">jonathan.magin@gmail.com</a>. If you have any questions about packet writing, you can send them to that email address also. Start writing!</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Writer Feedback</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><span style="color:#808080;">THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SENT INTO HIATUS DUE TO LOW INTEREST.</span></strong>

<span style="color:#808080;">ACF sponsors a writer feedback program designed to help quizbowlers of every level improve their question writing.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">How it works: send up to 5 questions to <a style="color:#808080;" href="mailto:feedback.acf@gmail.com">feedback.acf@gmail.com</a>, along with what level the questions are for and what you'd most like help with. We'll assign a member of ACF to correspond with you and give you feedback on your writing by reading your questions, critiquing them, and suggesting possible changes. We'll also try to answer any questions about writing for quizbowl that you may have.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">This program is open to all with no restrictions on who can participate. Everyone who wants to become a better writer, no matter how experienced you are, is welcome.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">If you'd like to use these questions at a college tournament, send a preliminary email with no questions attached to ensure that no one playing that tournament is able to see the questions. This preliminary email should state the tournament to which you plan to submit the questions.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">Also, if you are interested in ongoing feedback, please only submit one group of questions every two weeks; as a new program, we want to make sure we don't overtax our volunteers.</span>

<span style="color:#808080;">We look forward to receiving your questions and helping improve your writing!</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A friendly reminder: ACF editors will charge a </em><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2014-15-packet-submission-guidelines/#additional"><em>penalty</em></a><em> if you do not meet the guidelines below. So pay close attention to this section. </em>
<h2>Content Formatting</h2>
<h3>Fonts, Margins, etc.</h3>
Your submitted packet should be in Size 10 Times New Roman font. The margins should be 1 inch on all sides. The lines should be single spaced and spacing between paragraphs should be 0pt.

<em>Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</em>
<h3>Packet Header</h3>
In the first two lines, place the following in <strong>bold text</strong>:

&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt;
Packet by &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt; (Player1, Player2, Player3, etc.)

You should include the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Eg.

<strong>ACF Regionals 2014
Packet by Reno Tech B (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong>
<h3>Tossup formatting</h3>
Tossups should be 6-7 lines in length, with the occasional tossup going into the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> line. The last sentence of a tossup should begin with “For 10 points” (and not “FTP” or “F10P”) followed by a comma and a space.

<em>Do not number or indent your tossups</em>. <em>Do not include power-marks in your tossups</em>.
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Sample tossups</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Modified from 2008 ACF Fall packet by Cornell</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The Kidd glycoproteins present on the surface of these cells act as urea transporters. Spectrin and ankyrin are found in the cytoskeletal network of these cells and antibodies on their surface are detected by the direct Coombs test. They express high levels of CD47, which prevents phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen, and kidneys release EPO which stimulate the production of these. Excess production of them results in polycythemia, and their count is depressed in anemia. Produced in the bone marrow, they are biconcave and lack nuclei. For 10 points, identify these cells that contain hemoglobin, and help transport oxygen to tissues.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>red blood cell</strong></span>s [or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>RBC</strong></span>s; or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>erythrocyte</strong></span>s]</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This group’s creation was inspired by the book <em>Stride Towards Freedom</em>. A speech critical of Kennedy’s planned civil rights bill was given during the March on Washington by its leader, John Lewis, who also oversaw the organization of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party for the 1964 Democratic Convention. Initially started in Greensboro, North Carolina, it was formally organized in a conference led by Ella Baker at Shaw University. After the Watts Riots, it began to reject civil rights legislation and was taken over by its militant branch. For 10 points, name this civil rights organization that supported “black power” under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</strong></span> [or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>SNCC</strong></span>; or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Snick</strong></span>]</p>

<h3>Bonus formatting</h3>
Bonuses should have parts that are two lines long, with an occasional part that goes into the third line. Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Bonus leadin</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The first line of a bonus, the leadin, should include a description of the point values for the bonus parts. i.e., if it is a 3-part bonus, it should say “for 10 points each.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your bonus is structured so that each part is not worth 10 points (for example, if it contains a part that asks for two answers, each worth 5 points), make sure that the leadin indicates the variable structure, and that the part itself instructs the moderator and players of the point values. You leadin may say "For the stated number of points".</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Note: Do not submit very many, if any, bonuses with variable point structures.</em></p>

<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Sample Bonuses</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Modified from 2014 ACF Regionals packet by Northmont, Penn, and Chicago B</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>A regular bonus</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Mike Donovan, Gus Smith, and Jesse Jackson were unofficial mayors of these communities, which included Hardlucksville in New York. For 10 points each:
[10] Name these shantytowns that sprung up across the United States during the Great Depression and were named after a president.
ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hooverville</span></strong>s
[10] In New York City, part of this location was renamed Hoover Valley, with makeshift houses built along Depression Street.
ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Central Park</span>
</strong>[10] The unemployed lumberjack Jesse Jackson was a “mayor” in this West Coast city, where one of the largest and longest-lasting Hoovervilles was built on the old site of the Skinner and Eddy Shipyard.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Seattle</strong></span>, Washington</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>A variable valued bonus</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The UCC generally treats these instruments as “firm offers.” For the stated number of points:
[10] For 10 points, name these contracts in which one party pays for the opportunity to buy from the other or sell to the other at a set price for a period of time.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>option</strong></span> contracts [or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>options</strong></span>]
[5, 5] For 5 points each, these are the names given to the two general kinds of options, one an option to sell and one an option to buy.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>call</strong></span> option and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>put</strong></span> option [accept in either order]
[10] For 10 points, he binomial option pricing model is often used in the pricing of this kind of option, which can be exercised at any point before the expiration date.
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>American</strong></span> style options</p>

<h3>Answer-line formatting</h3>
The answer for any tossup or bonus part should be in its own line. The line should begin with the text “ANSWER: “; that is, the word “ANSWER” in all caps, followed by a colon and a space.

The required part of an answer should be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>underlined and bolded</strong></span>. If the answer is the title of a work like a book, a play, an opera, a painting, a film, etc. <em>it should be italicized</em>. If it is something contained within a larger collection, e.g. a short story, a chapter, a song, etc. it should be contained within quotes.

Any instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or additional instructions for moderators should be contained within brackets.
<h3>Standardization of numbers</h3>
To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. “twenty-two years”, “a million dollars” and “fourteen hundred casualties,” but “For 10 points” and “1976.”)

Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.
<h3>Other notes on formatting and grammar</h3>
Please delete all internal notes and conversations from the packet before submitting it.

<span style="color:#808080;">If there is a note that you would like to convey to the editors, please add it as a comment using MS Word, or leave a line before or after the question.</span>

<em>Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</em>

<em>Avoid using special characters if possible</em>. Characters with accents and other diacritical marks are okay.
<h2>Organizing your packet</h2>
Group your questions by category (i.e. all lit questions go together, all history go together, and so on.) Within a category, all tossups should appear before bonuses. The ordering of the categories does not matter. Within a category, the ordering of sub-categories doesn’t matter, either.

Below is a sample packet ACF Editor Rob Carson and his teammate Bernadette Spencer submitted for ACF Regionals 2014. Please consult this document for an illustration of what a well-formatted submission looks like.
[googleapps domain="docs" dir="file/d/0B8GP8Vgf2wezSlFiVGlIdG0zVWtvSGFsR0ZYM3hUSTdKUVBn/preview" query="" width="640" height="480" /]

  <title>ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
Any team with <em>at least</em> one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2013 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2014-2015.
<blockquote>FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?

All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments.

Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.</blockquote>
This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please contact the ACF editor for the tournament.
<h2>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.
<h3>Tossups</h3>
A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:
<blockquote>Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.</blockquote>
Do NOT write tossups which are:
<ul>
	<li>Geared toward specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
	<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
	<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:
<ul>
	<li>A clearly discernable easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
	<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
	<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.

You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.

We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, click here.
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
Please follow the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/acf-formatting-guidelines">ACF Formatting Guidelines</a> when formatting your packet.

Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or a “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</p>

<h3> Past ACF Events as models</h3>
In addition to the above question-writing guides, we encourage you to consult old ACF events as writing models.

We recommend:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For ACF Fall-level difficulty - <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/334/">ACF Fall 2008</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/82/">ACF Fall 2009</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/457/">ACF Fall 2012</a>;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For ACF Regionals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/310/">ACF Regionals 2008</a> and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/248/">ACF Regionals 2010</a>;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">For ACF Nationals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/298/">ACF Nationals 2009</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/247/">ACF Nationals 2010</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/650/">ACF Nationals 2014</a>.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
All Full Packet submissions should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the distribution outlined below.
<span style="color:#808080;"><em> For information on half-packet submissions for ACF Fall 2014, please reference the announcement <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/acf-fall-2014/">here</a>.</em></span>

</ul>
<em> Vary questions across time periods. Do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please make sure your questions span a variety of answers such as authors, novels, poems, criticism, essays, etc.</em>
<h3><strong>History</strong><strong> 5/5</strong></h3>
<ul>

<h2><a name="who"></a>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
Any team with <em>at least</em> one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2015 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2016-2017.

FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?
<p style="padding-left:30px;">All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments.

<p style="padding-left:30px;">Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.

This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/contacts/">contact the ACF editor for the tournament</a>.
<h2><a name="sample"></a>Sample Packet</h2>
Want to know what a well-formatted packet looks like? Take a look at this packet ACF member Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.

[googleapps domain="docs" dir="document/d/1VcuDQbNYG124iqvBu6AdXbcUq-3sOc_YP_dyjXvXTFE/pub" query="embedded=true" width="800" height="400" /]
<h2><a name="distribution"></a>Distribution</h2>
All Full Packet submissions should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the distribution outlined below.

The following distribution applies to ACF Regionals and ACF Nationals Submissions. See the <a href="#">2015 ACF Fall Announcement</a> for information about half-packet distributions. 

<em>Note: The X/Y notation used throughout this section refers to X tossups and Y bonuses. Eg. If you see Fine Arts 3/3, it means 3 tossups and 3 bonuses. </em>
<h3>Literature 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>British literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>European literature from 500 CE onwards: 1/1</li>
	<li>World (anything not covered above): 1/0 or 0/1</li>
	<li>Anything you want, including ancient European literature, more of any category above, or combinations of categories above: 1/2 or 2/1</li>
</ul>
<em> Vary questions across time periods. Do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please make sure your questions span a variety of answers such as authors, novels, poems, criticism, essays, etc.</em><strong>
</strong>
<h3>History 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American history: 1/1</li>
	<li>European, Canadian, and Australian history: 3/3 (1 should be on classical history, 1 on British history, and 3 on continental Europe from three different post-classical time periods.)</li>
	<li>World history: 1/1 (from two different areas of the world besides those covered above)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 4 questions on military history (battles, wars, or people known primarily for their military accomplishments.)</em>
<h3>Science 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Biology 1/1</li>
	<li>Chemistry 1/1</li>
	<li>Physics 1/1</li>
	<li>Math or computer science: 1 question</li>
	<li>Astronomy, earth science/geology, or other science not covered above: 1 question</li>
	<li>Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don’t write a second question on any of the “minor” fields. Questions which straddle the line between disciplines should be used for Any Science. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 1 question on the history of science. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered science rather than science history. </em>
<h3>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</li>
	<li>Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</li>
	<li>Philosophy: 1/1 (different parts of philosophical history)</li>
</ul>
<em>Write least 1 and no more than 2 questions in this category on non-Western topics.</em> <em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion for either history or religion, but don’t write about religious history for both categories. </em>
<h3>Fine Arts 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Painting: 1/1</li>
	<li>Classical music (excluding opera): 1/1</li>
	<li>Other Fine Arts: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film; do NOT write more painting or classical music)</li>
</ul>
<em>Write on a visual category and an auditory art Other Fine Arts. E.g. pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em>
<h3>Social Science 1/1</h3>
Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. (Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.)

<em>Do not write more than 1 question from a particular field of study. </em>
<h3>Geography 1/1</h3>
Possible topics for this category include physical features, countries, cities, regions, etc. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.

<em>Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Do not write both questions on the same area of the world. </em>
<h3>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</h3>
You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above. You can write questions which mix categories here.

<em>Do not write more than one trash question</em> <em>from the same general category. E.g. Don’t write two questions on sports.</em>
<h2><a name="philosophy"></a>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.
<h3>Tossups</h3>
A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.

Do NOT write tossups which are:
<ul>
	<li>Geared towards specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
	<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
	<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:
<ul>
	<li>An easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
	<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
	<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.

You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.

We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, <a href="#dp">click here</a>.
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
Please follow the ACF Formatting Guidelines when formatting your packet.

Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or an “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Past ACF Events as models</h3>
In addition to the above question-writing guides, we encourage you to consult old ACF events as writing models.

We recommend:
<ul>
	<li>For ACF Fall-level difficulty - <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/334/">ACF Fall 2008</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/82/">ACF Fall 2009</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/457/">ACF Fall 2012</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Regionals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/310/">ACF Regionals 2008</a> and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/248/">ACF Regionals 2010</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Nationals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/298/">ACF Nationals 2009</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/247/">ACF Nationals 2010</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/650/">ACF Nationals 2014</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how"></a>How to submit your packet</h2>
<h3>Document format</h3>
Please submit your packet as a .doc, .docx, or .rtf file. Submit all questions in 10-point Times New Roman font. Your document should have 1-inch margins on all sides. PDFs, .odt, .html, .txt or any other formats are <strong>not acceptable</strong>.

<em>If editors cannot open your packet on the first try, they will return your packet to you and have you re-send a fixed version before it is considered submitted for fee purposes.</em>
<h3>Document Name</h3>
Please follow the following file-naming scheme when submitting packets:
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;">&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt; - &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt;

For instance, if UC Irvine’s A team is submitting a packet for 2015 ACF Regionals, it should be named:
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ACF Regionals 2015 – UC Irvine A

<h2><a name="dp"></a>Discounts/Penalties</h2>
We offer discounts for early submission of packets, and levy a penalty for late packet submissions. Click here for the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-discountpenalty-schedule/">packet-submission discount/penalty schedules</a>.

<strong>Gross deviation from packet-formatting guidelines</strong>: $50 penalty

<strong>Submission of prohibited types of questions</strong>: $25 penalty per question

Prohibited types of questions include:
<ul>
	<li>Spelling questions, i.e. questions for which the answer involves spelling a word.</li>
	<li>Binary matching questions, i.e. questions of the form “Given X, name Y” which do not have prose clues.</li>
	<li>5-10-15 bonuses, i.e. bonuses whose hard-parts are worth 15 points. These questions should instead be changed to 10-10-10 bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="plagiarism"></a>Plagiarism</h2>
We do not tolerate plagiarism, and there will be consequences for any instances of plagiarism. Please refer to ACF’s policy on plagiarism.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi!

Welcome to the new ACF website. With the move to Wordpress, we will do a better job of keeping you updated on the happenings of ACF tournaments. Some pages are still under construction, but if you find any inconsistencies or feel like the content is unclear, please don't hesitate to email <a href="mailto:gkandlikar@gmail.com?Subject=ACF">Gautam Kandlikar</a>.

ACF Fall is coming up soon, so I hope you are gearing up for some awesome quizbowl! ]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In September, Jonathan Magin announced ACF's new writer feedback program:
<blockquote>On behalf of ACF, I'm very pleased to announce our writer feedback program, which is designed to help quizbowlers of every level improve their writing.

How it works: send up to 5 questions to <a href="mailto:feedback.acf@gmail.com">feedback.acf@gmail.com</a>, along with what level the questions are for and what you'd most like help with. We'll assign a member of ACF to correspond with you and give you feedback on your writing by reading your questions, critiquing them, and suggesting possible changes. We'll also try to answer any questions about writing for quizbowl that you may have.

This program is open to all with no restrictions on who can participate. Everyone who wants to become a better writer, no matter how experienced you are, is welcome.

If you'd like to use these questions at a college tournament, send a preliminary email with no questions attached to ensure that no one playing that tournament is able to see the questions.

Also, if you are interested in ongoing feedback, please only submit one group of questions every two weeks; as a new program, we want to make sure we don't overtax our volunteers.

We look forward to receiving your questions and helping improve your writing!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Dr. N.

</table>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>* Discounts in red are for optional packets. If you have any questions about this please read on.</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All the deadline days are Sundays. Packets must be submitted by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the specified days to count for that day's discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals 2012, a discount of $100 will be offered for packets that are submitted by January 23, 2013.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For more detailed instructions on paying for ACF tournaments, see <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/paying-for-acf-tournaments/">this document</a>.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="required"></a>Who is required to submit packets?</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2011 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2012-2013. All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals count as regular collegiate academic tournaments for this purpose, but trash or "hybrid" tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT "invitational series" questions do not. This test is applied to each individual team, not to your school's contingent as a whole. If, for example, your school sends three teams, and your A and C teams have a person who played college tournaments in 2006, but your B team does not, then only your A and C teams need to write packets. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please ask the appropriate editor at the address above. Exceptional cases, such as having one person on your team who played some tournaments ten years ago and is now returning to school, will be evaluated by the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament. The editors may grant one or more 24-hour extensions to the final deadline at an additional penalty of $10 per day. However, what will certainly not be allowed is for an experienced team to simply not write a packet at all. You may not "pay your way out of writing."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams comprised entirely of players who did not play a regular collegiate academic tournament prior to September 1, 2011 do not have to submit packets. However, you have the option of submitting a packet if you want to. For such teams, submitting a packet by the normal -$25 deadline will get you a -$50 discount, and submitting by the normal no-penalty deadline will get you a -$25 discount. Optional packets will not be accepted past the no-penalty deadline.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets should not be exposed to anyone outside of the specific team that is writing the packet; in all likelihood, your school's A team will play on the packet written by your school's B team, et cetera, so it is imperative that questions be kept blind to all competitors. This strictly applies to all potential players at the tournament – if you are on the B team, do not write questions for the A team's packet, even if you offer to sit out when that packet is read.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">See <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2012-13-packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">below</a> for additional, but easy-to-avoid, packet penalties.</span>

</table>
<span style="color:#999999;">Buzzer, staffer, laptop, travel, and international discounts apply to your school's total fee, not to each individual team's fee. The minimum total fee for a school is $0.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="discounts"></a>Discounts for shorthanded teams in financial duress:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which meet all of the following conditions, further discounts are available:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">A team of less than 3 people</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The team is being funded directly by its members (rather than by its school or by a team budget)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">If required to write a packet, the team writes a packet before the no-penalty deadline and it is of acceptable quality</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Under those circumstances, solo teams will get a discount of -$80 and two-person teams will get a discount of -$60. The teams will still be eligible for further discounts down to the minimum $0 fee.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams who are unable to pay the fee by the payment deadline but do not qualify for the above discount may negotiate for delayed payment (of the full fee) with the ACF treasurer. It is the policy of ACF that the inability to come up with money by the payment deadline will never exclude a team from playing in a tournament, as long as appropriate alternate arrangements for payment are made in advance.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a>Additional packet penalties:</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><strong>
</strong></span></span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><em>Formatting:
</em></span><span class="Apple-style-span">If your packet deviates in a major way from the formatting guidelines (random tabs and page breaks throughout, questions not sorted by category, every question has answers without the required part being indicated, etc) you will incur a $30 penalty on top of any other fees or discounts.</span><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has a large accumulation of minor deviations from the formatting guidelines (ten or more examples of no underlining, bonus parts preceded by letters or parentheses instead of bracketed numbers, bonus leadins or "for 10 points" not in proper format, etc) you will incur a $15 penalty.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has absolute compliance with the formatting guidelines you will get a $5 discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Formatting packets on the editing end because you chose not to follow the guidelines is necessary in order to make the packets clear for moderators, but it's also a HUGE timesink and there's no reason you can't do it properly while writing and leave us the time to edit the content of your questions instead. Please observe the formatting guidelines below and don't make the editor charge you a penalty for this. A few minor problems with formatting will not incur a penalty – we are not looking to screw anyone with the formatting penalties, and will reserve them only for packets that really cause headaches.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Plagiarism:
</em>If you submit a packet with any question in it that the editors can prove you plagiarized from an existing source, your packet fee will be +$200, your packet will not be used, and you will bring shame upon your entire family. Please read more about plagiarism <a style="color:#999999;" href="#plagiarism">here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prohibited types of questions:
</em>This is certainly not intended to penalize new teams for writing weak questions in general, but rather penalize people for writing specific types of questions which no one should be writing, ever, and which are specifically prohibited here.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a spelling question, that's +$25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple spelling questions, but you most certainly should not be doing that). Spelling questions are completely archaic in quizbowl today and reflect very lazy writing, yet at least one was submitted to a tournament recently, so we want to remind everyone that there should never, ever be a question asking people to spell anything.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a question with clues or phrasing from Wikipedia that cannot be verified with any other source, that's $25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple questions out of Wikipedia, however your packet will likely be returned if you do that; see below).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a "given the x, name the y" binary matching bonus with no prose clues at all, that's +$5 for each bonus of that kind. This could potentially be charged for as many as all 24 of your bonuses, but, of course, you can avoid it by not writing these bonuses. See below for details on what exactly is meant by this type of question. These questions are prohibited because they are extremely boring, especially to teams who do not know the answer. Write bonuses that maintain the attention of all teams and educate those who do not know about the bonus topic.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a 5-10-15 bonus, that's also +$5 for each bonus of that kind. Once more, this could potentially be charged for however many bonuses you write in this way, and once more, you should avoid this penalty by not writing any such bonuses. 5-10-15s shift the balance of rewarded skills too much towards knowing "hard parts" and depress scoring in games between teams of average ability, and should simply be changed to 10-10-10s.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">There is no reason any team should end up being charged a penalty for the above types of specifically prohibited questions, since this section spells out exactly how to avoid that. The editor assures you that if you are just an inexperienced writer submitting bad questions because of said inexperience, we will not try to gouge you out of money, and indeed will appreciate the effort you put into writing questions when you are unfamiliar with doing so. The only questions that will face financial surcharges are the specifically prohibited kinds above.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Consult individual tournament announcements for further difficulty guidelines (generally, ACF Regionals is a "normal difficulty" tournament, ACF Fall is quite easy). The below tips apply to all tournaments.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Tossups</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Dead tossups are the enemy of having fun at quizbowl tournaments, so above all, do not do not DO NOT write tossups on answers that are obscure (for ACF Fall and Regionals. For Nationals, some more leeway is permitted in the sense that you do not have to reasonably expect that everyone will know the answer, but you still should not write for only the top 3 teams.) Use easy answers, and make your early-in-the-question clues hard to provide the challenge, rather than using challenging answers for tossups. Ideally, there should be almost no tossups in the tournament which go unanswered at the end. If you want to ask about something harder, use it as one part of a bonus that also contains two easier parts, not as a tossup answer or as the subject for an entire bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"> Use interesting clues throughout your tossup. Avoid writing tossups which "fall off the difficulty cliff" before the "For 10 points" – e.g., if you write a tossup on Pietro Mascagni, don't put in five lines of superhard material followed by "For 10 points, name this composer of Cavalliera Rusticana." Either write on something else, or use the "in one of his operas, such-and-such happens" clue style to provide useful middle clues. All tossups should have those middle clues, not just a sudden dropoff in difficulty at the end. In a game between two good teams, almost no tossups should go past "For 10 points" before someone buzzes.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Bonus questions</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For bonus parts, prose clues are greatly preferred to abrupt phrases or lists. Bonuses composed entirely of sentence fragments, such as the "given the holiday, name the religion in which it is celebrated" type of bonus questions, are prohibited and will incur penalties (see above). You can write the same bonus as "name these religions" and work the same clues into some more aesthetically pleasing complete sentences.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This is what is meant by a prohibited binary matching bonus:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works from characters, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, Manolin, a shark</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Old Man and the Sea</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Margaret, Robert Wilson, a lion</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell, The Grand Maestro, Renata</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Across the River and Into the Trees</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This is what you should write instead:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, who has not caught a fish in eighty-five days, wrestles with an enormous marlin only to have it eaten by sharks during the trip back to Havana's harbor, in this late novella.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Old Man and the Sea</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] In this short story, a former cosmetics model threatens to leave her husband, who was revealed as a coward during a lion hunt. Margaret eventually shoots the title character during an encounter with a buffalo, and Robert Wilson approves.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell shoots ducks on the way to Venice's Gritti Palace Hotel, then Cantwell and Countess Renata get it on in a gondola. After buying a brooch, Cantwell joins the Order of Brusadelli and dies of a heart attack at the end of this novel.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Across the River and Into the Trees</strong></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">See how the second example teaches something and recaps interesting parts of the story so that even people who don't know the answers get something out of the question? This is what you should write. Notice that you can still incorporate most or all the clues from the bad bonus in example 1 into the better clues from example 2, so writing good questions does not have to mean writing harder questions. Note that "Given a line from a poem, name the poem" with no other clues still counts as a binary matching bonus and should not be written.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Furthermore, please use actual clues in your bonus leadins whenever possible. For example, if you are writing a bonus about Chandragupta, but can't use his name in the leadin because it is the first answer, do not write "Answer the following about an Indian ruler for 10 points each." instead, write "He was the founder of the Mauryan dynasty. For 10 points each:" and include a second clue in the first part. This keeps people from being bored by filler words and provides extra space for more clues, thus making it more likely that players will get questions right.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Write nearly all of your bonus questions as above: 3 parts worth 10 points each, with one part being no harder than a tossup answer, another being slightly more challenging, and the remaining part being harder still, though still something you would expect a person well-read in the subject of the bonus to know in five seconds. If you are unsure about the difficulty of a particular question, then you should probably err on the side of easier and write on something else instead. You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10, if this seems necessary to you for some reason. The 30-20-10 format and other multi-part, single-answer bonus questions are not permitted in ACF, nor is the 5-10-15 format. The 5-10-15 specifically just has no sensible place in quizbowl and will incur a financial penalty as described above; just write the same question as a 10-10-10.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not use any other aberrant bonus formats such as listing six things for 5 points each, but if you come up with a really great bonus in such a format, it will constitute an acceptable part of your packet and the editors will consider using it. However, all bonus scoring schemes must have a one-to-one relationship between each answer and a certain amount of points – ACF will never use bonuses of the "name four things, 5 points each and an extra 10 for all correct" type. Bonuses that involve putting things in any sort of correct order or rank, regardless of the scoring scheme, are prohibited.</span>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Clues and Answers to Avoid:</span></h2>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#999999;">You may find it useful to review <a style="color:#999999;" title="Subash Maddipoti’s Tips on Question Writing" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipoti's Ten Tips For Question Writing</a>. Keep in mind this important point from the above document:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You should omit useless information such as "His intermittent surrealist depictions and use of vivid color belied the realism and monochromatic pigments that the public associated with him." This sort of knowledge is of course very important to fully understanding whatever painter we're talking about in a classroom context, but phrased in that manner, it simply does not help anyone in a match get the question, no matter how much he or she knows about art. Make sure every clue in your tossups is a specific, helpful, and uniquely identifying piece of information about the answer.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please apply that point to ALL of your questions and omit useless nonclues like "the protagonist of this novel is a thoughtful, sensitive man hardened by circumstance" or "this psychologist graduated from secondary school in London and briefly studied at Oxford." Clues which point to dozens of possible answers, rather than one, or which are just boring biographical details with no relevance to the reason that the answer is important are what we mean by "nonclues."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">In particular, please do not tell us where or when someone was born, what their father's profession was, or where they went to college. We don't care and neither do the people who will be playing your questions – instead, talk about interesting, memorable, and unique things that this person did in their field of prominence.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not put useless phrases like "from clues" or "from descriptions" in your bonus leadins. For example, write "name these British novels for 10 points each;" don't write "name these British novels from clues for 10 points each." It is understood that the bonus will contain clues and that players are not expected to just divine three works of English literature upon hearing the bonus leadin, so don't waste time and space putting in those phrases.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Avoid using words such as "famously" "well known" or "best" in your questions. These are subjective and unhelpful terms. Replace them with specific, concrete information about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that the first instance of any pronoun (he, she, it, they) or form of the word "this" in a tossup must always refer only to the answer, and subsequent pronouns and demonstrative adjectives should be thoroughly scrutinized for any potential to mislead players.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="alternate"></a><strong>Alternate Answers:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember to include these forms of alternate answers:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the reverse names for Supreme Court cases; also, in cases where neither party name is "the United States" or the name of a state, one party name is sufficient to get the question right, and the underlining should reflect this.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for any work of literature/art not originally in English</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for people with descriptive words in their names</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the birth name of people who are well-known by a pseudonym</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both formal and native language names for countries as alternate answers (both Britannica and the CIA Factbook are quick places to find all the names used for a country)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both the Pinyin and Wade-Giles forms of Romanized Chinese names and other Chinese words</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">When including alternate answer notes, omit needlessly long phrases such as "also accept;" simply write "or." Do not include insulting notes such as "begrudgingly accept" or "accept from people who can't speak French." Either an answer is acceptable, or it is not; no further commentary is desired. Follow the below models and use only "or" and "prompt on" as appropriate for alternate answers that are acceptable at any point in the question.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong> v. Connecticut [or Connecticut v. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Romer</span></strong> v. Evans [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evans</span></strong> v. Romer]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Elixir of Love</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">L'Elisir d'amore</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim I</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim the Grim</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim Yavuz</span></strong>; prompt on "Selim"]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: John <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wayne</span></strong> [or Marion Robert<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Morrison</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Republic of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azerbaijan</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azarbaycan</span></strong> Respublikasi]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cixi</span></strong> (see-shee) [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tzuhsi</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xiaoqin</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xianhuanghou</span></strong>]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Use "accept ___ before it is read" when a potential alternate answer is used in the question. Do not use asterisks within the question text to denote this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Example:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: George <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Orwell</span></strong> [accept <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eric Blair</span></strong> before it is read]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Additional notes on answer lines:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For the moderator's convenience, list answers in the expected order of likelihood of hearing them from a team (this usually means English titles first). Remember to underline answers in accordance with the ACF rules on required parts; specifically, you should usually not underline a leading "The" or its equivalent in other languages. Also note that it is not necessary to include phonetically identical alternate spellings on the answer line.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="length"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Question length</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">The edited packets for most ACF events will have tossups of no more than 6-7 lines and bonus parts of no more than 2 (in 10-point Times New Roman with one-inch margins). You should submit slightly longer questions so that we can whittle out excess words or remove a repeated clue and end up with questions of the desired final length. One or two tossups of 4-5 lines are acceptable, but a whole packet of them is probably not deep enough. Likewise, writing more than a handful of tossups that are longer than 9 lines is pointless, since we will be eliminating a lot of your clues if you do that to make all tossups fit under the final length cap.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><em>Example tossup construction:</em></strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">For an example of what we mean by interesting and useful clues: a tossup on Henry VIII should start off talking about his specific relationships to some lesser-known historical incidents and people, such as:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Agents of this king executed Richard Whiting at Toe Hill. Earlier, he joined Aragon's war with France, winning great popularity when his general, the Earl of Surrey, defeated a Scottish force at Flodden Field.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">The question should then talk about some material likely to be encountered in an undergraduate course dealing with Henry VIII but still lesser-known to the casual person:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prior to authorizing the Ten Articles, he sponsored the construction of such ships as the Mary Rose. He also suppressed the Pilgrimage of Grace and wrestled with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Then, the tossup should go on to hint at what he is best-known for with clues like</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>He attempted to persuade Pope Clement VII to intercede against his own violation of Leviticus, despite earlier using Deuteronomy to win the support of Julius II.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Finally, the question should conclude with some names widely associated with Henry and the giveaway clue:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>His chancellors Thomas Wolsey and Thomas More both fell out of his good graces, leading to the martyrdom of More during this man's creation of the Church of England. For 10 points, name this father of Elizabeth I and husband to Catherine Parr, Anne Boleyn, and four other women.</em></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This question rewards deep knowledge and teaches something interesting to those who didn't know much about Henry VIII before, yet it is still, ultimately, a tossup on a very well known answer which presumably every team can get by the last clue. Such tossups are what we are looking for in your packet submissions. Note also that the tossup, when put together, is noticeably longer than the 6-line cap we will be enforcing on the edited questions – again, please submit your questions this way so that we can edit them into very dense 6-line tossups for the final packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">A question on Henry VIII which relies on things like birth dates or quotations is very boring and is probably not usable, while a question which starts off saying something like "He was a longtime rival of the Papacy and finally took drastic action against it" encourages wild guessing based on minimal knowledge and does not allow players with deeper knowledge of the subject to get the tossup first, and is not usable for those reasons. Similarly, literature questions should rely on plot scenarios and character names first, less so on rote association of titles with authors, in order to reward people who have actually read the books. Myth questions that are on traditional topics such as specific deities should talk about interesting anecdotes involving the figure, not just be a boring list of stock clues like "his symbol was a hexahedron made of onyx, his temple was at Rondopolis, his head looked like a badger's." If such clues are the most well known thing about the figure in question, they do have a place at the end of a tossup, but they should not comprise the whole question. Similar principles apply to all categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Questions on people have a major place in the tournament but should be balanced by questions on works, events, concepts, etc.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="distribution"></a></span></h2>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Distribution: </span></h2>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Please write between 1 and 2 total questions on distinctly non-Western things for the overall RMP category.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion (e.g., the Council of Chalcedon) for either history or religion, but don't write about religious history for both categories. A question which could be considered either religion or myth (e.g., Brahma) can be counted as one of your religion questions.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Fine Arts 3/3</strong></span>
<ul>Painting: 1/1 Classical music excluding opera: 1/1 Everything else: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film, or other arts not covered under painting or classical music)</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Please pick one largely visual category and one largely auditory category for your "everything else" subjects – e.g, pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Social Science 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. The two questions should not come from the same field of study. Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Geography 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Also, please do not write both questions on the same area of the world. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above, or you can write questions which mix categories here. If you write two trash questions then they should not be from the same general category (e.g. one should be on sports and one on TV, or one on music and one on video games; don't write both on visual media or both on sports).</span></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="formatting"></a>Formatting:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that if you don't meet these formatting requirements, we will charge you a <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">penalty</a>, so pay close attention to this section. We are aware that these are very specific requirements and may seem like overkill, but when multiplied by 10 or 20 packets, any slight variations in formatting become a major distraction from the kind of work we really need to be doing on the actual content of the questions, so we would really appreciate everyone following the formatting guidelines religiously.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets must be submitted as some sort of file that can with certainty be opened properly on any computer running Microsoft Word 2002 and can support all of the formatting requirements below. I.e.: submitting them as .doc files, .rtf files, or an exact equivalent to either is strongly preferred. Packets submitted as Word 2007 .docx files are NOT acceptable since those files cannot be opened on older versions of Word. If any of the editors cannot open your packet on the first try, it will be returned and you will have to fix it before it is considered submitted for fee purposes. The filename should be the name of your school, with the letter designating your specific team if your school is sending more than one. USC.doc, UCLA B.doc, or Irvine A.doc are examples of file names we wish to see.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please consult the sample properly <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/acf/formatting-sample.doc">formatted packet</a>. Make your questions look as much like that, aesthetically, as possible, while using the appropriate difficulty level for the particular tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Everything in your packet should be in Times New Roman font of size 10. Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">At the top of the packet, put, in boldface, the tournament name (e.g, <strong>ACF Fall 2008</strong> or <strong>ACF Regionals 2009</strong>), followed on the next line by your school name. Be sure to designate whether it is the A team, B team, etc if your school is sending multiple teams. This should be followed by the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Thus, the top of every packet should look something like this:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>ACF Regionals 2009
Packet by Reno Tech B Team (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Format your tossups like this:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Toward the end of its first act, one of the characters sings "I Know You Hate Me" after being whipped by the protagonist's wife. A peasant sings "Why Hast Thou Taught Me" to woo the hand of that wife, who is known as Columbine in Act Two. After Beppe sings an ode to Columbine, the protagonist confronts Nedda about Silvio, and when she brushes him off he stabs her, leading Tonio to end the opera with the line "La Commedia Finita." For 10 points, name this opera by Ruggierio Leoncavallo, whose first act ends with the melancholy "Vesti La Giubba" and whose protagonist is a very sad clown.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <em>I <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pagliacci</span></strong></em> [or The <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Clowns</span></strong></em>]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The last sentence begins with "For 10 points" (not FTP or For ten points) followed by a comma and a space (not by a colon, a dash, or nothing).</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The question text DOES NOT begin with a number or an indentation.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Format your bonus questions like these:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">It was a response to the prejudiced selections of the official Salon de Paris. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Name this art exhibition which was first held in 1863.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salon des Refuses</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Salon of the Rejected</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] One of the prominent paintings exhibited in the Salon des Refusés was this huge Edouard Manet painting depicting a nude woman sitting between two clothed men in an outdoor setting.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <em>Le <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dejeuner sur l'Herbe</span></strong></em> [or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Luncheon on the Grass</span></strong></em>; or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Picnic on the Grass</span></strong></em>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Salon des Refuses also featured The White Girl, a painting by this American artist. The painting is also known as his Symphony in White, Number 1.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: James McNeill <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whistler</span></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Name these places that one might see on a peaceful trip down the Danube, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Danube originates in this wooded mountain area in the far southwest of Germany which extends from Säckingen to Durlach.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Forest</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schwarzwald</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Before emptying into the Black Sea, the river passes through this capital of Slovakia.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bratislava</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Rhine-Main-Danube canal allows continuous travel from the Danube to the Rhine Delta, which is found on the North Sea at this city, the second most populous in the Netherlands and the busiest port in the world.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rotterdam</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets and separated from each other by semicolons.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The bonus instruction indicates that the three parts are valued "for 10 points each" and either forms a general instruction for the whole bonus (in which case it ends with a period) or provides a specific clue pertaining to the first part of the bonus (in which case it ends with a colon).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples of the two different types of bonus instructions:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these novels by Charlotte Bronte, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Identify these characters from Plato's Symposium, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Name these authors of works set in the Netherlands, for 10 points each.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">He drew a perfect circle to demonstrate his artistic prowess to the Pope. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> The Longmen Grottoes and White Horse Temple are among the religious artifacts found here. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> According to Hesiod, she is the daughter of Ceto and Phorcys. For 10 points each:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write any bonus questions using different point schemes, then make sure to clearly reflect how the points will be awarded in the bonus instruction. If you use a "for the stated points" bonus format, then the value of each part should be indicated both in the brackets and in the text of the bonus parts themselves, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">His essay "Some Remarks on Logical Form" and a preface he wrote for a dictionary for elementary schools are collected in his<em>Philosophical Occasions</em>. For the stated points:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, name this twentieth-century philosopher of language, whose aphorisms are collected in such books as <em>Culture and Value</em> and<em>Zettel</em>.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Ludwig <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wittgenstein</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, at the end of this first book by Wittgenstein, he asserts that anyone who has understood the book's propositions can now discard them as one would discard a ladder after climbing it.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, Wittgenstein's most important later book is this work which claims that concepts denote "family resemblances" between things and argues that there cannot be a "private language."</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Philosophical Investigations</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, Wittgenstein once threatened this author of The Open Society and its Enemies and proponent of falsificationism with a fireplace poker.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Karl Raimund <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Popper</span></strong></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Standardization of numbers:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. "twenty-two years", "a million dollars" and "fourteen hundred casualties," but "For 10 points" and "1976.") Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Other notes on formatting and grammar:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please delete all of your internal notes from the packet before submitting it. Editors do not want to see stuff like "lit: american (FF)" scattered throughout the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Pay attention to parallel structure and the antecedents of pronouns. Some rules of grammar can and should be ignored in order to make your questions pyramidal and concise, but those two are actually very helpful in making your tossups understandable. When you start a sentence with "The king won victories at Battle A, Battle B, and...", you need to conclude it with "Battle C," not "promoted his foreign secretary to vizier." You also need to make sure to avoid stray "this" and "it"s in your questions – if you want to refer back to a previous sentence, use a form of "that" instead to avoid confusing people about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use any unusual Word templates, and pay attention when converting text from other file formats. If you paste something in, use the "paste as unformatted text" option so it doesn't bring a minefield of crazy style tags with it. There should not be any point in your document where that little template box in Word says anything besides "Normal."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Manual line breaks, tabs, and that little thing that looks like a degree sign should not be used ever. There should be nothing in your document besides letters, numbers, standard punctuation, italics, bold, underlining, spaces, and paragraph returns.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that using parsimony in non-essential words keeps players from being bored and makes it easier for us to get tossups down to six lines and bonus parts down to two. E.g., "name" instead of "answer questions regarding" in bonus leadins.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Use one inch margins in your packets. This makes it possible for standardized length requirements to be meaningful.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use the subjunctive when the simple past is suitable. Instead of "He would go on to write Bricks Without Straw" , say "He wrote Bricks Without Straw" or "He went on to write Bricks Without Straw." It just sounds better, places the clue more concretely in time, and usually saves words.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="pronunciation"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation Guides:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation guides are usually a waste of time, to be honest. Put them in only under the following conditions:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">You actually know how to pronounce the word and are not just guessing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The pronunciation guide itself is clear.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">There is a substantial chance that the word will be mispronounced without the guide, and that the mispronunciation of the word will make it unrecognizable to players or mislead them into thinking it is a different clue. E.g.., don't put in guides like "Nabokov (nuh-BAHK-off)" – even though that is correct, no player is going to be confused if they hear the incorrect pronunciation "NAH-buh-kov," so you're just wasting everyone's time putting the guide in.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Or, if it's an answer, there's a substantial chance that a moderator will not recognize the correct pronunciation because it differs substantially from the appearance of the word on the page. Chinese words transliterated with an "x" standing for an "sh" sound or a "zh" standing for a "j" sound are common pitfalls here, and should receive pronunciation guides in answers.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">If you choose to put in a pronunciation guide under the above circumstances, put it in parentheses, with phonetic spelling and emphasized syllables in all caps, immediately after the relevant word, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Arthur Rubinstein commissioned a Fantasia by this man, who wrote incidental music to the dramas The Passion and Daybreak. One of his works contains a ritornello in the section "Jota" (HO-tuh). His stage works include the puppet opera The Tale of Master Pedro...</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [etc, etc]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Manuel de Falla</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="wikipedia"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia reminder:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia is not a reliable source for meeting the stringent standards of factual accuracy which quizbowl questions must maintain. We will not accept any questions containing clues whose only source is Wikipedia. If you use Wikipedia in your question writing process, then you should cross-check each and every clue gleaned from any Wikipedia article with an established source. It will probably be more time-efficient for you to avoid using Wikipedia at all. If you are having trouble finding good places to look up information for questions, please contact the editor of the tournament you are writing for.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets containing questions which are determined to have come solely from Wikipedia will be returned for rewriting and will not count as submitted for purposes of the fee schedule until such questions have been replaced. You will also be <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">charged $25</a> on top of your eventual fee for submitting your revised packet.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="plagiarism"></a>Plagiarism and recycling: </span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism of any kind in your packet submissions for this tournament is absolutely unacceptable. In general, anything that is considered plagiarism for coursework at your school will be considered plagiarism in your submitted packet. In particular, note that our concept of plagiarism includes but is not limited to lifting wording directly from Wikipedia, Britannica, or any encyclopedia, webpage, book, or other reference source without attribution; and taking questions or parts of questions from previously existing quizbowl packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams caught plagiarizing will have their packets rejected and will not be given the opportunity to write a replacement. Such teams will be substantially penalized, as per the notice in the penalties section--i.e., you will either be charged hundreds of dollars, or kicked out of the tournament. We promise you that we WILL catch you if you are plagiarizing. Please make sure that every person writing for your packet is fully aware of the consequences of plagiarism.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Also, your packet may not include any questions that were previously submitted to any tournament whatsoever. Even if your previous questions were not used at the other tournament, you do not know for certain who assisted the editors of the prior tournament or otherwise may have seen your questions, and thus you cannot guarantee that the people who saw your questions are not playing in this tournament. While less serious than plagiarism, question recycling is, likewise, totally prohibited and will result in bad things happening to you, so you should take pains to avoid engaging in this practice.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Thank you for your patience is getting through these long guidelines. They are long and detailed because we want to put on the best tournaments possible, with the best packets possible. Please contact the appropriate tournament editor if you have any further questions.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Bidding process
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate editor at the address listed above. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">When the editors receive more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: whom they expect to attract more teams, and whom they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Ideally, all bids will be received no later than twelve weeks before the tournament date, and the editors will award bids to hosts in each of the ten regions no later than ten weeks before the tournament date. In reality, only the more active regions are likely to have their bids decided by that time, and it may take some additional weeks before a host can be found in a less active region, so the announcement of bids may be staggered.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial breakdown between hosts and editors
</strong>The base fee for each "normal" team that participates in your tournament is $120, as described in the packet and fee guidelines. Of this, you can consider $70 the base fee for you, the host, and $50 the base fee for the editors. All packet discounts and penalties (including early/late packet adjustments, and supplementary penalties for formatting or plagiarism) are added to or subtracted from the $50 that is to be paid to the editors: For example, if a team submits their packet at the -$25 deadline, then (ignoring all other discounts), they pay ACF $95, and ACF pays you $70 and the editors only $25, since the $25 comes out of the editors' share. Similarly, all logistical discounts for buzzers, laptops, staffers, and travel affect your cut: A team that has no packet adjustment and brings 1 buzzer and 1 staffer to the tournament pays $105; ACF will send you $55 and the editors will keep $50, since the logistical discounts come out of your share. The $25 "new ACF team" discount is split 15/10: $15 comes out of the editors' share, and $10 comes out of the hosts' share.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The following unusual cases will have their fees split up differently: Teams which receive the new quizbowl team discount, teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and house teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which receive the "new quizbowl team discount" of $100, you do not owe the editors anything. Any money they do pay is yours. Normally, such teams will pay around $20. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams than from all others.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host gets $21 and the editors get $14.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you will receive a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial viability
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1200. You should expect to spend about $100 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament (the trophy costs will be handed by ACF). You should expect $500 to go to the editors, and about $600 as your team's profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Host requirements
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must use the official <a style="color:#999999;" title="Official ACF Rules" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/official-acf-rules/">ACF rules</a> for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable "round reports"), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/index.html">here</a> . If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Unless a host receives explicit permission from the head editor to run fewer, at least ten meaningful games must be offered to all teams. ACF recommends offering at least eleven games.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team's PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors' share of the entry fees. Starting in 2012-13, ACF will provide trophies to hosts at reasonable cost. ACF will pay the trophy provider directly (including shipping to the host site) and the cost will come out of the host site's share. The anticipated cost is less than $50 total per host.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams will receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects fewer than four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament two weeks before the tournament, when the trophies are ordered, then the host must inform ACF that it will opt out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies. If the host receives Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, or if there are four or more teams that qualify, the Undergraduate and/or Division II titles must be awarded.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers. If the host opts out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, but it turns out that there are enough teams to award either or both of those titles, hosts must award the titles and make reasonable efforts to award prizes to the winners.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Payment from ACF to Hosts
</strong>Starting in 2012-13, ACF is moving to a direct-payment system, in which teams will pay the ACF treasurer (Jerry Vinokurov) directly, and the treasurer will disburse payment owed to the host sites.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">After host sites are confirmed, the treasurer will contact each host to find out the following information: to whom to make out the check, to whom to mail the check, and to identify any possible stumbling blocks in the payment process (such as vendor or other tax forms that must be filled out, etc.).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Within one week after the tournament, the treasurer will send a payment breakdown to each host site, laying out the packet fees for each team, the split between ACF and the host, and the identities of any teams that have not yet paid and attended that site. The team representatives will be asked to confirm the breakdown and to email any delinquent teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">After the breakdown is confirmed, each host site will be paid as soon as each team attending that host site has paid all packet fees and penalties.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>For ACF Nationals</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Penalties for Egregious Hosting Violations</strong></span>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Fewer than ten games offered* to each team</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$10 per team affected</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Delay in paperwork causing egregious delay</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">flat $50 penalty</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Failure to play off or award UG/DII titles despite having enough teams or trophies to award either/both of those titles</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$50 for each title not awarded</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Failure to keep or post stats</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">flat $20 penalty</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Ineligible team plays tournament without prior permission</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$100, or ineligible team's entire registration fee, whichever is larger</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Site run in egregious violation of or ignoring the official ACF rules or hosting guidelines</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$50 penalty and possible ban from hosting</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="color:#999999;">*No penalties will be levied if teams elect to leave early on their own volition, causing schedules to drop below the minimum number of games. Hosts may not, however, encourage teams to leave early.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">At the treasurer or head editor's discretion, first-time violations may result in a warning instead of a monetary penalty.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts should talk to the head editor of the tournament, or the ACF treasurer, to bring up any potential issues with the above penalties before they arise. The editor/treasurer may exempt hosts from requirements if it benefits the site.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="color:#999999;"> United Kingdom: Warwick</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF Fall is still currently seeking a host for the Texas-area site. Hosting is a good way to cut down on travel costs, raise money, and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you have any interest in hosting or questions about it, please refer first to the official <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/hosting-guidelines/2011-2012/">ACF Hosting Guidelines</a>, and then e-mail Matt Bollinger at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:mlb7vb@virginia.edu">mlb7vb@virginia.edu</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> As per the ACF submission rules, any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2011 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2012-2013. This includes ACF Fall. As of a recent rule change, high school players are now included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams. Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit packets to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:mlb7vb@virginia.edu">mlb7vb@virginia.edu</a> and use “ACF Fall 2012: [Team Name]” in the subject line. This year’s submission schedule is:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This year’s submission schedule is:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet submitted before 11:59 PM eastern time on:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 9, 2012: -$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 23, 2012: -$25 (-$50 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 7, 2012: No penalty (-$25 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 14, 2012: +$25</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 21, 2012: +$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> After Oct. 21, 2012: The editors may grant one or more 24-hour extensions at an additional penalty of $10 per day.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Please take a moment to review the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#formatting">ACF Packet Guidelines on formatting</a> to make sure you format your packet correctly.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. Teams caught plagiarizing will be subject to large fines and possibly a thread not dissimilar to <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6868&amp;start=0">this one</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Writing specific types of forbidden questions: Types of questions prohibited at ACF events include spelling questions, binary matching bonuses, and 5-10-15 bonuses.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please see the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">additional packet penalties section</a> for more info.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Friendly Reminders</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Please refer to the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Guidelines</a> document for more detailed explanations of packet submission and fee-related information.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets or talk about their contents.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2012 is the same as it has been for the past four years, such as can be seen in ACF Fall 2009 and ACF Fall 2010. These tournaments can be found on <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a>. Remember above all that the tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before, in both your answerlines and your selection of clues. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please let Matt know at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:mlb7vb@virginia.edu">mlb7vb@virginia.edu</a>.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Change to ACF's Division II rules - 10/16/12</title>
  <link>http://acf-quizbowl.com/2012/10/16/change-to-acfs-division-ii-rules-101612/</link>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is just to announce that ACF has changed the definition of Division II. The new definition of Division II follows:
<blockquote>C12. For collegiate tournaments that recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of “Division II” status, a “Division II” player is:

C12.1. At ACF Fall and Regionals, and any other collegiate tournament except ACF Nationals, any player who meets the definition of “undergraduate” and has never played ACF Nationals

C12.2. At ACF Nationals, any freshman or sophomore player (measured by time in school, not by credits)</blockquote>
The rationale for this change is that, at Fall and Regionals, the purpose of Division II is to get more teams to attend who otherwise might not, and reward those who do well while being "newer" players. So, at Fall and Regionals, Division II should be for any person meeting Undergraduate status who has never participated in ACF Nationals previously (even as a high schooler). At Nationals, we want to ensure that the title has a meaningful field competing for it and we don't end up with people afraid to play Nationals earlier because it might mess up their future team's eligibility.

We realize that this means that some teams that have already registered as Undergrad teams may, in fact, be Division II teams. Fear not! We will be in touch with you over the next day or two to figure out what division your teams qualify for and to correct your previous registrations, if necessary.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong>

<span style="color:#999999;">This is the official global announcement for ACF Regionals 2013, which will take place on February 23, 2013.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Editors:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Head Editor: Chris Ray (Maryland)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Co-Editors: John Lawrence (King's College London), Cody Voight (VCU), Rob Carson (Ball So Hard University)</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Note that we are now actively seeking hosts in most regions - please contact us at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a> if you're interested. Bids will remain open for two weeks before we begin running down sites ourselves, so please indicate your interest ASAP if you'd like first crack at it.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">West: UCSD</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Pacific Northwest:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> South: Rice</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Southeast: University of South Carolina</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Great Lakes: Chicago</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Midwest: WUStL</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> East Canada/Niagara: University of Toronto</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Mid-Atlantic: University of Maryland</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Northeast: Brown</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We may add or condense certain sites depending on how bids shake out to make sure we're making the best choices possible for the most teams. In particular, interested parties in that whole Midwest Regionals thing should contact me and explain to me what consensus (if any) was reached on the issue.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet Submission:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Every team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2011 is required to submit a packet in order to play in Regionals. Please note that, like last year, this requirement also applies to eligible high school teams. Further information can be found at the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The submission schedule for this tournament is:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> December 30, 2012: -$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 13, 2013: -$25 (-$50 for optional packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 27, 2013: no penalty (-$25 for optional packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 3, 2013: +$25</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 10, 2013: +$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> After that: My unending wrath, +$100, and a guarantee you will be dropped from the field if you haven't negotiated an extension before then.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Payment Deadline (NEW): February 16, 2013 (your payment must be postmarked by this date).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit your packet to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a>; the actual email with attached packet should include the phrase "[name of school + A/B/etc. if applicable) PACKET" in the subject line. In order to meet any particular deadline, your packet must be in our inbox by 11:59 pm PST on the stated day.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">As alluded to above, extensions *may* be granted after the final February 10 deadline, but are at my discretion and will certainly not be granted if the request appears mysteriously at 11:58 pm the night of the deadline.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet Penalties: Be sure to fully read the information contained in the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2012-13-packet-submission-guidelines/">Packet Guidelines</a>. Any cases of incorrect formatting, plagiarism, or prohibited question types will result in hefty fees. The editors also reserve the right to send back any egregious cases to be fixed by the team in question, so be sure to do it right the first time.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please note that in cases of plagiarism in particular, I have now graded many a term paper and edited many a tournament, and I will catch you. This is doubtless because if you have decided to plagiarize from past questions/wikipedia/wherever, you are an idiot; I encourage you to cut your losses with that rather than compounding the situation with plagiarism.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">New in 2013</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please note that ACF Regionals, like all ACF events, is using the new centralized payment system this year. Some updates will be made, but the general information on how this worked for ACF Fall are available in <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=13640">this thread</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Also note the change in Division II eligibility rules (also in place for ACF Fall), as announced <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=13640">here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit all questions/comments/etc. regarding this event to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a>, or post them in the thread. Running packet list (with deadlines/penalties) will appear below as soon as packets begin to come in.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Best,</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Chris Ray</span>

  <title>ACF Cheating Policy</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ACF has recently codified its policy on cheating:<br /><br />A player who has been shown to have cheated at an ACF event, or has been credibly proven to have cheated at any other organized academic competition, will be banned indefinitely from the time ACF receives the credible report until that player states a desire to play an ACF event, accompanied with a statement of contrition or countervailing evidence. When ACF receives that information, it will conduct a vote to determine whether the player can participate in the tournament in question, and if not, determine a formal length of a ban from ACF events. If there are any questions about whether a third-party report of cheating is credible, any Full member of ACF can call a vote of the Full members in which a simple majority will decide whether or not the report is credible.<br /><br />According to this policy, the four players deemed to have inappropriately accessed questions by NAQT (in <a href="http://naqt.com/ict/2012/unauthorized-question-access.html">these</a> <a href="http://naqt.com/articles/security-review-update.html">two</a> reports) are indefinitely banned from participating in ACF tournaments. ACF is also considering bans against other individuals.

<strong>Update - 3/30/13:</strong>

ACF has also voted to indefinitely ban the individuals identified in <a href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=12970">these</a> <a href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=189318#p189318">three</a> <a href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=210264#p210264">reports</a> as having cheated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>ACF Nationals 2013</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color:#000000;"><b>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</b></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This is the announcement for this year's Academic Competition Federation national championship tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF Nationals this year will be held at Columbia University in vibrant New York City. The tournament will be held on the weekend of Saturday, April 27, and Sunday, April 28, 2013.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The tournament will convene in Hamilton Hall on the Columbia campus at 8:00 AM on Saturday the 27th and run until around 6:00 PM, then finish from 8 AM to about 2 PM on Sunday the 28th.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be the head editor of this tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Matt Weiner will be Tournament Director. Nationals will once again be a fully staffed, efficiently run tournament with a sensible format that remembers to award the Undergraduate and Division II trophies.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Our current recommendation is that teams stay in northern New Jersey and take the train to the tournament. You will find better pricing on hotels and not have to deal with parking in Manhattan, for which ACF takes no responsibility. A longer list of specific suggested hotels is to follow, but right now I suggest looking at the Hyatt Place Secaucus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any questions about the logistics of ACF Nationals that you need answered right now, feel free to post here or e-mail Matt Weiner at mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com. We're looking forward to a healthy field and a great event.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be taking registrations for the tournament, so if you want to sign up before you hand your packet in, contact him at jonathan.magin@gmail.com.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> To register for this tournament, please fill out this webform. If you need to change your information after submitting it, please email Susan Ferrari at srferrar@gmail.com</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet submission, eligibility, and fee schedule:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Information on who is eligible to play ACF tournaments and details regarding packet submission can be found at the ACF Packet Submission Guidelines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Fee schedule:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Base fee: $260</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$100 discount: January 23</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$50 discount: February 6</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$25 discount: February 20</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> No penalty: March 6</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$25 penalty: March 13</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$50 penalty: March 20</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">NOTE: No packets will be accepted later than two weeks before the tournament!</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">New for this year! If your team brings (fully pays for/does not claim any reimbursement from the tournament for) a qualified moderator, you will receive a $100 discount. Qualified moderators are people who can properly complete an ACF Nationals round in thirty minutes. I, Matt Weiner, will be the sole judge of who is qualified, both prior to and during the tournament, and will not award the discount if your staffer fails to meet this requirement. You may, theoretically, claim this discount as many times as possible until your fee reaches $0.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF cannot make this any clearer: After the $50 deadline, you will owe the editors $10/day; if you cannot turn in a packet more than two weeks in advance of ACF Nationals, you will not be playing ACF Nationals. This is a hard and fast deadline and there will be no exceptions.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This year, ACF will continue the 50 dollar discount for teams who write at least 20/20 that doesn't need any major editing and submit their packet by the no penalty deadline. By major editing, we mean things like having to change many of the clues and/or answerlines and having to fix many grammatical errors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We would much rather give out lots of hefty discounts for excellent early packets than rake in money for late ones, so please take advantage of them.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">There is a field cap of 33 teams for this tournament; should more than 33 teams register, a waitlist will be formed.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Distribution:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Literature: This includes 1/1 American, 1/1 British, 1/1 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre (for instance, please don't submit 5/5 on French literature or 5/5 poetry).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 History: This includes 1/1 American, 2/2 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please make sure that your questions aren't all from the same time period or place and aren't all one type of history (for instance, try not to submit 5/5 political history or 5/5 military history).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Science: This includes 1/1 Biology, 1/1 Chemistry, 1/1 Physics, and 2/2 Other Science (including areas like Astronomy, Earth Science, Math, and Computer Science). Please don't write two questions about the same scientific subdistribution.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 Arts: This includes 1/1 Painting, 1/1 Classical Music, and 1/1 Other (including Architecture, Sculpture, Opera, Jazz, Ballet/Dance, Art Film, and Photography). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 RMP: This includes 1/1 Religion, 1/1 Mythology, and 1/1 Philosophy. Please do not write both religion questions on the same religion or both mythology questions on the same myth system.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Social Science: This includes Psychology, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, and Social Criticism. Please write your tossup and bonus on different areas of social science.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Geography/Current Events: These questions should be about different parts of the world. Geography questions that incorporate cultural and environmental clues instead of purely discussing physical features are particularly welcome.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Other Academic: This includes questions from every preceding category, as well as answers that don't quite fit into any of the preceding categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Keep in mind that ACF Nationals does not have trash; if you submit any trash questions, they will simply be sent back.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To reiterate, please vary the distribution of your questions. In past years, we had teams submit packets with both chemistry questions about the same narrow area, to present one example, and it would prevent many headaches if you make sure your questions are reasonably distributed. Also, please remember that while the goal of ACF Nationals is to determine the best team in the nation, writing primarily about extremely difficult topics is not the best way to achieve this, so please try to keep your fellow players in mind while choosing your answer lines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This announcement comes with ample time for everyone to start writing their Nationals packets and submit them as early as possible. We want to give you every opportunity to save money on this fantastic event and save us the trouble of having to edit a bunch of packets at the last minute. You should avail yourself of this chance posthaste.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All packets should be sent to jonathan.magin@gmail.com. If you have any questions about packet writing, you can send them to that email address also. Start writing!</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong>
<strong><span style="color:#999999;">This is the official global announcement for the 2013 edition of ACF Fall, which will take place on November 2, 2013.</span></strong>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Editors</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Editor-in-chief: Stephen Liu (Harvard)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Assistant Editors: Tanay Kothari (UC Berkeley), Ankit Aggarwal (UC Berkeley), Andrew Hart, Adam Silverman (Georgia Tech), Lloyd Sy (Brown), and Stephen Eltinge (MIT).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We'd like to see ACF Fall hosted at each of the above regions. A Missouri site may be reasonable depending on the distances to the host sites in nearby regions, but if you wish to host in the Missouri area please do not hesitate to contact me. In general, hosting this tournament is a good way to cut down on travel costs, raise money, and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you have any interest in hosting or questions about it, please refer first to the official ACF Hosting Guidelines (available here: http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2012-13-hosting-guidelines/) and then e-mail Stephen Liu at the Gmail address acf.fall.2013.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The deadline for bids is September 14, 2013. Bids will not be accepted after that point, and earlier bids will receive priority over later bids, all else being equal.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> As per the ACF submission rules, any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2012 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2013-2014. This includes ACF Fall. Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament. As of a recent rule change, high school players are now included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams. (For more on high school teams, please see below.) Please submit packets to the same Gmail account, "acf.fall.2013", and use “ACF Fall 2013: [Team Name]” in the subject line.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"> International: -$20</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> For teams representing schools located in a different country than the tournament host.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> New ACF teams: -$25</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> For schools who did not send a team to ACF Fall, Regionals, or Nationals between September 2011 and August 2013, and have no one on the team(s) claiming this discount who played those tournaments for another school.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> New quizbowl teams: -$75</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> For schools who did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament since September 2011, and have no one on the team(s) claiming this discount who played those tournaments for another school. May be combined with new ACF team discount for a total new-team discount of $100.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This year’s submission schedule is:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packet submitted before 11:59 PM eastern time on:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 8, 2013: -$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 22, 2013: -$25 (-$50 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 6, 2013: No penalty (-$25 for teams not required to submit packets)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 13, 2013: +$25</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 20, 2013: +$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> After Oct. 20, 2013: The editors may grant one or more 24-hour extensions at an additional penalty of $10 per day.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Please take a moment to review the ACF Packet Guidelines on formatting to make sure you format your packet correctly.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. People caught plagiarizing will be subject to large fines and public shaming.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Writing specific types of forbidden questions: Types of questions prohibited at ACF events include spelling questions, binary matching bonuses, and 5-10-15 bonuses.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please see the additional packet penalties section for more info.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Note Regarding High School Teams</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> High school teams are welcome to play this tournament, though they should keep in mind that while this may be a lower difficulty tournament, it is nevertheless a collegiate event and significantly more difficult than many high school tournaments. There will be no further discounts for things like playing short-handed or being new to ACF or quizbowl, which applies only to new college teams. Furthermore, high school teams must write a packet if any of its members played a college tournament prior to the 2012-2013 competition season.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Friendly Reminders</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Please refer to the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Guidelines</a> document for more detailed explanations of packet submission and fee-related information.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets or talk about their contents.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2013 is the same as it has been for the past four years, such as can be seen in ACF Fall 2009 and ACF Fall 2010. These tournaments can be found at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a>. Remember above all that the tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before, in both your answerlines and your selection of clues. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please let Stephen know at the email address listed above.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a name="who"></a>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
Any team with <em>at least</em> one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2013 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2014-2015.

FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?
<p style="padding-left:30px;">All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.</p>
This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please c<a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/contacts/">ontact the ACF editor for the tournament</a>.
<h2><a name="sample"></a>Sample Packet</h2>
Want to know what a well-formatted packet looks like? Take a look at this packet our editor Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.

[googleapps domain="docs" dir="document/d/1VcuDQbNYG124iqvBu6AdXbcUq-3sOc_YP_dyjXvXTFE/pub" query="embedded=true" width="800" height="400" /]
<h2><a name="distribution"></a>Distribution</h2>
All Full Packet submissions should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the distribution outlined below.

For information on half-packet submissions for ACF Fall 2014, please reference the announcement <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/acf-fall-2014/">here</a>.

<em>Note: The X/Y notation used throughout this section refers to X tossups and Y bonuses. Eg. If you see Fine Arts 3/3, it means 3 tossups and 3 bonuses. </em>
<h3>Literature 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>British literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>European literature from 500 CE onwards: 1/1</li>

	<li>Anything you want, including ancient European literature, more of any category above, or combinations of categories above: 1/2 or 2/1</li>
</ul>
<em> Vary questions across time periods. Do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please make sure your questions span a variety of answers such as authors, novels, poems, criticism, essays, etc.</em><strong>
</strong>
<h3>History 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American history: 1/1</li>
	<li>European, Canadian, and Australian history: 3/3 (1 should be on classical history, 1 on British history, and 3 on continental Europe from three different post-classical time periods.)</li>
	<li>World history: 1/1 (from two different areas of the world besides those covered above)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 4 questions on military history (battles, wars, or people known primarily for their military accomplishments.)</em>
<h3>Science 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Biology 1/1</li>
	<li>Chemistry 1/1</li>

	<li>Math or computer science: 1 question</li>
	<li>Astronomy, earth science/geology, or other science not covered above: 1 question</li>
	<li>Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don’t write a second question on any of the “minor” fields. Questions which straddle the line between disciplines should be used for Any Science. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 1 question on the history of science. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered science rather than science history. </em>
<h3>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</li>
	<li>Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</li>
	<li>Philosophy: 1/1 (different parts of philosophical history)</li>
</ul>
<em>Write least 1 and no more than 2 questions in this category on non-Western topics.</em> <em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion for either history or religion, but don’t write about religious history for both categories. </em>
<h3>Fine Arts 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Painting: 1/1</li>
	<li>Classical music (excluding opera): 1/1</li>
	<li>Other Fine Arts: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film; do NOT write more painting or classical music)</li>
</ul>
<em>Write on a visual category and an auditory art Other Fine Arts. E.g. pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em>
<h3>Social Science 1/1</h3>
Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. (Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.)

<em>Do not write more than 1 question from a particular field of study. </em>
<h3>Geography 1/1</h3>
Possible topics for this category include physical features, countries, cities, regions, etc. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.

<em>Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Do not write both questions on the same area of the world. </em>
<h3>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</h3>
You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above. You can write questions which mix categories here.

<em>Do not write more than one trash question</em> <em>from the same general category. E.g. Don’t write two questions on sports.</em>
<h2><a name="philosophy"></a>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.
<h3>Tossups</h3>
A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.</p>
Do NOT write tossups which are:
<ul>
	<li>Geared towards specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
	<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
	<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:
<ul>
	<li>An easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
	<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
	<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.

You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.

We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, <a href="#dp">click here</a>.
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
Please follow the ACF Formatting Guidelines when formatting your packet.

Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or an “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Past ACF Events as models</h3>
In addition to the above question-writing guides, we encourage you to consult old ACF events as writing models.

We recommend:
<ul>
	<li>For ACF Fall-level difficulty - <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/334/">ACF Fall 2008</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/82/">ACF Fall 2009</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/457/">ACF Fall 2012</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Regionals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/310/">ACF Regionals 2008</a> and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/248/">ACF Regionals 2010</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Nationals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/298/">ACF Nationals 2009</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/247/">ACF Nationals 2010</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/650/">ACF Nationals 2014</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how"></a>How to submit your packet</h2>
<h3>Document format</h3>
Please submit your packet as a .doc, .docx, or .rtf file. Submit all questions in 10-point Times New Roman font. Your document should have 1-inch margins on all sides. PDFs, .odt, .html, .txt or any other formats are <strong>not acceptable</strong>.

<em>If editors cannot open your packet on the first try, they will return your packet to you and have you re-send a fixed version before it is considered submitted for fee purposes.</em>
<h3>Document Name</h3>
Please follow the following file-naming scheme when submitting packets:
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;">&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt; - &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt;</p>
For instance, if UC Irvine’s A team is submitting a packet for 2015 ACF Regionals, it should be named:
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ACF Regionals 2015 – UC Irvine A</p>

<h2><a name="dp"></a>Discounts/Penalties</h2>
We offer discounts for early submission of packets, and levy a penalty for late packet submissions. Click here for the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-discountpenalty-schedule/">packet-submission discount/penalty schedules</a>.

<strong>Gross deviation from packet-formatting guidelines</strong>: $50 penalty

<strong>Submission of prohibited types of questions</strong>: $25 penalty per question

Prohibited types of questions include:
<ul>
	<li>Spelling questions, i.e. questions for which the answer involves spelling a word.</li>
	<li>Binary matching questions, i.e. questions of the form “Given X, name Y” which do not have prose clues.</li>
	<li>5-10-15 bonuses, i.e. bonuses whose hard-parts are worth 15 points. These questions should instead be changed to 10-10-10 bonuses.</li>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Bidding process
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate editor at the address listed above. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">When the editors receive more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: whom they expect to attract more teams, and whom they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Ideally, all bids will be received no later than twelve weeks before the tournament date, and the editors will award bids to hosts in each of the ten regions no later than ten weeks before the tournament date. In reality, only the more active regions are likely to have their bids decided by that time, and it may take some additional weeks before a host can be found in a less active region, so the announcement of bids may be staggered.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial breakdown between hosts and editors
</strong>The base fee for each "normal" team that participates in your tournament is $120, as described in the packet and fee guidelines. Of this, you can consider $70 the base fee for you, the host, and $50 the base fee for the editors. All packet discounts and penalties (including early/late packet adjustments, and supplementary penalties for formatting or plagiarism) are added to or subtracted from the $50 that is to be paid to the editors: For example, if a team submits their packet at the -$25 deadline, then (ignoring all other discounts), they pay ACF $95, and ACF pays you $70 and the editors only $25, since the $25 comes out of the editors' share. Similarly, all logistical discounts for buzzers, laptops, staffers, and travel affect your cut: A team that has no packet adjustment and brings 1 buzzer and 1 staffer to the tournament pays $105; ACF will send you $55 and the editors will keep $50, since the logistical discounts come out of your share. The $25 "new ACF team" discount is split 15/10: $15 comes out of the editors' share, and $10 comes out of the hosts' share.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The following unusual cases will have their fees split up differently: Teams which receive the new quizbowl team discount, teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and house teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which receive the "new quizbowl team discount" of $100, you do not owe the editors anything. Any money they do pay is yours. Normally, such teams will pay around $20. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams than from all others.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host gets $21 and the editors get $14.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you will receive a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial viability
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1200. You should expect to spend about $100 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament (the trophy costs will be handed by ACF). You should expect $500 to go to the editors, and about $600 as your team's profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Host requirements
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must use the official <a style="color:#999999;" title="Official ACF Rules" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/official-acf-rules/">ACF rules</a> for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable "round reports"), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/index.html">here</a> . If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Unless a host receives explicit permission from the head editor to run fewer, at least ten meaningful games must be offered to all teams. ACF recommends offering at least eleven games.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team's PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors' share of the entry fees. Starting in 2012-13, ACF will provide trophies to hosts at reasonable cost. ACF will pay the trophy provider directly (including shipping to the host site) and the cost will come out of the host site's share. The anticipated cost is less than $50 total per host.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams will receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects fewer than four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament two weeks before the tournament, when the trophies are ordered, then the host must inform ACF that it will opt out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies. If the host receives Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, or if there are four or more teams that qualify, the Undergraduate and/or Division II titles must be awarded.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers. If the host opts out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, but it turns out that there are enough teams to award either or both of those titles, hosts must award the titles and make reasonable efforts to award prizes to the winners.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Payment from ACF to Hosts
</strong>Starting in 2012-13, ACF has moved to a direct-payment system, in which teams will pay the ACF treasurer (Jerry Vinokurov) directly, and the treasurer will disburse payment owed to the host sites.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">After host sites are confirmed, the treasurer will contact each host to find out the following information: to whom to make out the check, to whom to mail the check, and to identify any possible stumbling blocks in the payment process (such as vendor or other tax forms that must be filled out, etc.).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Within one week after the tournament, the treasurer will send a payment breakdown to each host site, laying out the packet fees for each team, the split between ACF and the host, and the identities of any teams that have not yet paid and attended that site. The team representatives will be asked to confirm the breakdown and to email any delinquent teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">After the breakdown is confirmed, each host site will be paid as soon as each team attending that host site has paid all packet fees and penalties.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>For ACF Nationals</strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Penalties for Egregious Hosting Violations</strong></span>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Fewer than ten games offered* to each team</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$10 per team affected</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Delay in paperwork causing egregious delay</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">flat $50 penalty</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Failure to play off or award UG/DII titles despite having enough teams or trophies to award either/both of those titles</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$50 for each title not awarded</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Failure to keep or post stats</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">flat $20 penalty</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Ineligible team plays tournament without prior permission</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$100, or ineligible team's entire registration fee, whichever is larger</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">Site run in egregious violation of or ignoring the official ACF rules or hosting guidelines</span></td>
<td><span style="color:#999999;">$50 penalty and possible ban from hosting</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span style="color:#999999;">*No penalties will be levied if teams elect to leave early on their own volition, causing schedules to drop below the minimum number of games. Hosts may not, however, encourage teams to leave early.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">At the treasurer or head editor's discretion, first-time violations may result in a warning instead of a monetary penalty.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Hosts should talk to the head editor of the tournament, or the ACF treasurer, to bring up any potential issues with the above penalties before they arise. The editor/treasurer may exempt hosts from requirements if it benefits the site.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>* Discounts in red are for optional packets. If you have any questions about this please read on.</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All the deadline days are Sundays. Packets must be submitted by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on the specified days to count for that day's discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals 2014, a discount of $100 will be offered for packets that are submitted by January 12, 2014.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For more detailed instructions on paying for ACF tournaments, see <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/paying-for-acf-tournaments/">this document</a>.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="required"></a>Who is required to submit packets?</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2012 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2013-2014. All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals count as regular collegiate academic tournaments for this purpose, but trash or "hybrid" tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT "invitational series" questions do not. This test is applied to each individual team, not to your school's contingent as a whole. If, for example, your school sends three teams, and your A and C teams have a person who played college tournaments in 2006, but your B team does not, then only your A and C teams need to write packets. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please ask the appropriate editor at the address above. Exceptional cases, such as having one person on your team who played some tournaments ten years ago and is now returning to school, will be evaluated by the editors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament. The editors may grant one or more 24-hour extensions to the final deadline at an additional penalty of $10 per day. However, what will certainly not be allowed is for an experienced team to simply not write a packet at all. You may not "pay your way out of writing."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams comprised entirely of players who did not play a regular collegiate academic tournament prior to September 1, 2012 do not have to submit packets. However, you have the option of submitting a packet if you want to. For such teams, submitting a packet by the normal -$25 deadline will get you a -$50 discount, and submitting by the normal no-penalty deadline will get you a -$25 discount. Optional packets will not be accepted past the no-penalty deadline.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets should not be exposed to anyone outside of the specific team that is writing the packet; in all likelihood, your school's A team will play on the packet written by your school's B team, et cetera, so it is imperative that questions be kept blind to all competitors. This strictly applies to all potential players at the tournament – if you are on the B team, do not write questions for the A team's packet, even if you offer to sit out when that packet is read.</span>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="discounts"></a>Discounts for shorthanded teams in financial duress:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For teams which meet all of the following conditions, further discounts are available:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">A team of less than 3 people</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The team is being funded directly by its members (rather than by its school or by a team budget)</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">Under those circumstances, solo teams will get a discount of -$80 and two-person teams will get a discount of -$60. The teams will still be eligible for further discounts down to the minimum $0 fee.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams who are unable to pay the fee by the payment deadline but do not qualify for the above discount may negotiate for delayed payment (of the full fee) with the ACF treasurer.

<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a>Additional packet penalties:</span><span class="Apple-style-span"><strong>
</strong></span></span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"><em>Formatting:
</em></span><span class="Apple-style-span">If your packet deviates in a major way from the formatting guidelines (random tabs and page breaks throughout, questions not sorted by category, every question has answers without the required part being indicated, etc) you will incur a $30 penalty on top of any other fees or discounts.</span><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has a large accumulation of minor deviations from the formatting guidelines (ten or more examples of no underlining, bonus parts preceded by letters or parentheses instead of bracketed numbers, bonus leadins or "for 10 points" not in proper format, etc) you will incur a $15 penalty.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your packet has absolute compliance with the formatting guidelines you will get a $5 discount.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Formatting packets on the editing end because you chose not to follow the guidelines is necessary in order to make the packets clear for moderators, but it's also a HUGE timesink and there's no reason you can't do it properly while writing and leave us the time to edit the content of your questions instead. Please observe the formatting guidelines below and don't make the editor charge you a penalty for this. A few minor problems with formatting will not incur a penalty – we are not looking to screw anyone with the formatting penalties, and will reserve them only for packets that really cause headaches.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Plagiarism:
</em>If you submit a packet with any question in it that the editors can prove you plagiarized from an existing source, your packet fee will be +$200, your packet will not be used, and you will bring shame upon your entire family. Please read more about plagiarism <a style="color:#999999;" href="#plagiarism">here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prohibited types of questions:
</em>This is certainly not intended to penalize new teams for writing weak questions in general, but rather penalize people for writing specific types of questions which no one should be writing, ever, and which are specifically prohibited here.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a spelling question, that's +$25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple spelling questions, but you most certainly should not be doing that). Spelling questions are completely archaic in quizbowl today and reflect very lazy writing, yet at least one was submitted to a tournament recently, so we want to remind everyone that there should never, ever be a question asking people to spell anything.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a question with clues or phrasing from Wikipedia that cannot be verified with any other source, that's $25 (no more than one penalty of this kind will be charged even if you write multiple questions out of Wikipedia, however your packet will likely be returned if you do that; see below).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a "given the x, name the y" binary matching bonus with no prose clues at all, that's +$5 for each bonus of that kind. This could potentially be charged for as many as all 24 of your bonuses, but, of course, you can avoid it by not writing these bonuses. See below for details on what exactly is meant by this type of question. These questions are prohibited because they are extremely boring, especially to teams who do not know the answer. Write bonuses that maintain the attention of all teams and educate those who do not know about the bonus topic.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write a 5-10-15 bonus, that's also +$5 for each bonus of that kind. Once more, this could potentially be charged for however many bonuses you write in this way, and once more, you should avoid this penalty by not writing any such bonuses. 5-10-15s shift the balance of rewarded skills too much towards knowing "hard parts" and depress scoring in games between teams of average ability, and should simply be changed to 10-10-10s.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">There is no reason any team should end up being charged a penalty for the above types of specifically prohibited questions, since this section spells out exactly how to avoid that. The editor assures you that if you are just an inexperienced writer submitting bad questions because of said inexperience, we will not try to gouge you out of money, and indeed will appreciate the effort you put into writing questions when you are unfamiliar with doing so. The only questions that will face financial surcharges are the specifically prohibited kinds above.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>In summary:</em></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Major formatting problems: +$30</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">A large amount of minor formatting problems: +$15</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Perfect formatting: -$5</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism in packet: +$200, packet rejected, elaborate Yiddish curse placed upon you</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Any spelling question in packet: +$25</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Any clue with Wikipedia as its only source: +$25</span></li>

</ul>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="philosophy"></a>Writing philosophy</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Consult individual tournament announcements for further difficulty guidelines (generally, ACF Regionals is a "normal difficulty" tournament, ACF Fall is quite easy). The below tips apply to all tournaments.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Tossups</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Dead tossups are the enemy of having fun at quizbowl tournaments, so above all, do not do not DO NOT write tossups on answers that are obscure (for ACF Fall and Regionals. For Nationals, some more leeway is permitted in the sense that you do not have to reasonably expect that everyone will know the answer, but you still should not write for only the top 3 teams.) Use easy answers, and make your early-in-the-question clues hard to provide the challenge, rather than using challenging answers for tossups. Ideally, there should be almost no tossups in the tournament which go unanswered at the end. If you want to ask about something harder, use it as one part of a bonus that also contains two easier parts, not as a tossup answer or as the subject for an entire bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"> Use interesting clues throughout your tossup. Avoid writing tossups which "fall off the difficulty cliff" before the "For 10 points" – e.g., if you write a tossup on Pietro Mascagni, don't put in five lines of superhard material followed by "For 10 points, name this composer of Cavalliera Rusticana." Either write on something else, or use the "in one of his operas, such-and-such happens" clue style to provide useful middle clues. All tossups should have those middle clues, not just a sudden dropoff in difficulty at the end. In a game between two good teams, almost no tossups should go past "For 10 points" before someone buzzes.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Bonus questions</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">For bonus parts, prose clues are greatly preferred to abrupt phrases or lists. Bonuses composed entirely of sentence fragments, such as the "given the holiday, name the religion in which it is celebrated" type of bonus questions, are prohibited and will incur penalties (see above). You can write the same bonus as "name these religions" and work the same clues into some more aesthetically pleasing complete sentences.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This is what is meant by a prohibited binary matching bonus:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works from characters, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, Manolin, a shark</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Old Man and the Sea</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Margaret, Robert Wilson, a lion</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell, The Grand Maestro, Renata</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Across the River and Into the Trees</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This is what you should write instead:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these Ernest Hemingway works, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Santiago, who has not caught a fish in eighty-five days, wrestles with an enormous marlin only to have it eaten by sharks during the trip back to Havana's harbor, in this late novella.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Old Man and the Sea</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] In this short story, a former cosmetics model threatens to leave her husband, who was revealed as a coward during a lion hunt. Margaret eventually shoots the title character during an encounter with a buffalo, and Robert Wilson approves.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber</strong></span></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Richard Cantwell shoots ducks on the way to Venice's Gritti Palace Hotel, then Cantwell and Countess Renata get it on in a gondola. After buying a brooch, Cantwell joins the Order of Brusadelli and dies of a heart attack at the end of this novel.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Across the River and Into the Trees</strong></span></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">See how the second example teaches something and recaps interesting parts of the story so that even people who don't know the answers get something out of the question? This is what you should write. Notice that you can still incorporate most or all the clues from the bad bonus in example 1 into the better clues from example 2, so writing good questions does not have to mean writing harder questions. Note that "Given a line from a poem, name the poem" with no other clues still counts as a binary matching bonus and should not be written.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Furthermore, please use actual clues in your bonus leadins whenever possible. For example, if you are writing a bonus about Chandragupta, but can't use his name in the leadin because it is the first answer, do not write "Answer the following about an Indian ruler for 10 points each." instead, write "He was the founder of the Mauryan dynasty. For 10 points each:" and include a second clue in the first part. This keeps people from being bored by filler words and provides extra space for more clues, thus making it more likely that players will get questions right.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Write nearly all of your bonus questions as above: 3 parts worth 10 points each, with one part being no harder than a tossup answer, another being slightly more challenging, and the remaining part being harder still, though still something you would expect a person well-read in the subject of the bonus to know in five seconds. If you are unsure about the difficulty of a particular question, then you should probably err on the side of easier and write on something else instead. You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10, if this seems necessary to you for some reason. The 30-20-10 format and other multi-part, single-answer bonus questions are not permitted in ACF, nor is the 5-10-15 format. The 5-10-15 specifically just has no sensible place in quizbowl and will incur a financial penalty as described above; just write the same question as a 10-10-10.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not use any other aberrant bonus formats such as listing six things for 5 points each, but if you come up with a really great bonus in such a format, it will constitute an acceptable part of your packet and the editors will consider using it. However, all bonus scoring schemes must have a one-to-one relationship between each answer and a certain amount of points – ACF will never use bonuses of the "name four things, 5 points each and an extra 10 for all correct" type. Bonuses that involve putting things in any sort of correct order or rank, regardless of the scoring scheme, are prohibited.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><span class="Apple-style-span"> Jerry Vinokurov has put together <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">an article</a> which immerses newcomers in the basic principles of good writing. The <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/#" target="_blank">Collegiate Quiz Bowl Packet Archive</a> contains a variety of tournament sets that follow the above principles Other tournaments to consult as writing models include <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/fall2008.zip" target="_blank">2008 ACF Fall</a>, <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/ACFFall2009.zip" target="_blank">2009 ACF Fall</a>, <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/acf_regs/2008" target="_blank">2008 ACF Regionals</a>, <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/2010ACFRegionals.zip" target="_blank">2010 ACF Regionals</a>, <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/acf_nats/2009" target="_blank">2009 ACF Nationals</a>, and <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/archive/2010ACFNats.zip" target="_blank">2010 ACF Nationals</a>. While all of those tournaments will give you stylistic models for general use, you should adjust the difficulty of your questions to that desired by the particular event: ACF Fall should be of a comparable difficulty to ACF Fall of past years. ACF Regionals should be comparable to Regionals 2008 or NAQT Sectionals. ACF Nationals should be harder than Regionals, but closer to the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2013 Nationals than to the 2005 or 2011 editions. Any tournament editor will answer further questions about writing.</span><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="additional"></a></strong></span>

<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Clues and Answers to Avoid:</span></h2>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#999999;">You may find it useful to review <a style="color:#999999;" title="Subash Maddipoti’s Tips on Question Writing" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipoti's Ten Tips For Question Writing</a>. Keep in mind this important point from the above document:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You should omit useless information such as "His intermittent surrealist depictions and use of vivid color belied the realism and monochromatic pigments that the public associated with him." This sort of knowledge is of course very important to fully understanding whatever painter we're talking about in a classroom context, but phrased in that manner, it simply does not help anyone in a match get the question, no matter how much he or she knows about art. Make sure every clue in your tossups is a specific, helpful, and uniquely identifying piece of information about the answer.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Please apply that point to ALL of your questions and omit useless nonclues like "the protagonist of this novel is a thoughtful, sensitive man hardened by circumstance" or "this psychologist graduated from secondary school in London and briefly studied at Oxford." Clues which point to dozens of possible answers, rather than one, or which are just boring biographical details with no relevance to the reason that the answer is important are what we mean by "nonclues."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">In particular, please do not tell us where or when someone was born, what their father's profession was, or where they went to college. We don't care and neither do the people who will be playing your questions – instead, talk about interesting, memorable, and unique things that this person did in their field of prominence.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not put useless phrases like "from clues" or "from descriptions" in your bonus leadins. For example, write "name these British novels for 10 points each;" don't write "name these British novels from clues for 10 points each." It is understood that the bonus will contain clues and that players are not expected to just divine three works of English literature upon hearing the bonus leadin, so don't waste time and space putting in those phrases.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Avoid using words such as "famously" "well known" or "best" in your questions. These are subjective and unhelpful terms. Replace them with specific, concrete information about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that the first instance of any pronoun (he, she, it, they) or form of the word "this" in a tossup must always refer only to the answer, and subsequent pronouns and demonstrative adjectives should be thoroughly scrutinized for any potential to mislead players.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="alternate"></a><strong>Alternate Answers:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember to include these forms of alternate answers:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the reverse names for Supreme Court cases; also, in cases where neither party name is "the United States" or the name of a state, one party name is sufficient to get the question right, and the underlining should reflect this.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for any work of literature/art not originally in English</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the original-language title for people with descriptive words in their names</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">the birth name of people who are well-known by a pseudonym</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both formal and native language names for countries as alternate answers (both Britannica and the CIA Factbook are quick places to find all the names used for a country)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">both the Pinyin and Wade-Giles forms of Romanized Chinese names and other Chinese words</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">When including alternate answer notes, omit needlessly long phrases such as "also accept;" simply write "or." Do not include insulting notes such as "begrudgingly accept" or "accept from people who can't speak French." Either an answer is acceptable, or it is not; no further commentary is desired. Follow the below models and use only "or" and "prompt on" as appropriate for alternate answers that are acceptable at any point in the question.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong> v. Connecticut [or Connecticut v. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Griswold</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Romer</span></strong> v. Evans [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Evans</span></strong> v. Romer]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: The <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Elixir of Love</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">L'Elisir d'amore</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim I</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim the Grim</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Selim Yavuz</span></strong>; prompt on "Selim"]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: John <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wayne</span></strong> [or Marion Robert<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Morrison</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Republic of <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azerbaijan</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Azarbaycan</span></strong> Respublikasi]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cixi</span></strong> (see-shee) [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tzuhsi</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xiaoqin</span></strong>; or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xianhuanghou</span></strong>]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Use "accept ___ before it is read" when a potential alternate answer is used in the question. Do not use asterisks within the question text to denote this.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Example:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">ANSWER: George <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Orwell</span></strong> [accept <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eric Blair</span></strong> before it is read]</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Additional notes on answer lines:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">For the moderator's convenience, list answers in the expected order of likelihood of hearing them from a team (this usually means English titles first). Remember to underline answers in accordance with the ACF rules on required parts; specifically, you should usually not underline a leading "The" or its equivalent in other languages. Also note that it is not necessary to include phonetically identical alternate spellings on the answer line.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="length"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Question length</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">The edited packets for most ACF events will have tossups of no more than 6-7 lines and bonus parts of no more than 2 (in 10-point Times New Roman with one-inch margins). You should submit slightly longer questions so that we can whittle out excess words or remove a repeated clue and end up with questions of the desired final length. One or two tossups of 4-5 lines are acceptable, but a whole packet of them is probably not deep enough. Likewise, writing more than a handful of tossups that are longer than 9 lines is pointless, since we will be eliminating a lot of your clues if you do that to make all tossups fit under the final length cap.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><em>Example tossup construction:</em></strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">For an example of what we mean by interesting and useful clues: a tossup on Henry VIII should start off talking about his specific relationships to some lesser-known historical incidents and people, such as:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Agents of this king executed Richard Whiting at Toe Hill. Earlier, he joined Aragon's war with France, winning great popularity when his general, the Earl of Surrey, defeated a Scottish force at Flodden Field.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">The question should then talk about some material likely to be encountered in an undergraduate course dealing with Henry VIII but still lesser-known to the casual person:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prior to authorizing the Ten Articles, he sponsored the construction of such ships as the Mary Rose. He also suppressed the Pilgrimage of Grace and wrestled with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Then, the tossup should go on to hint at what he is best-known for with clues like</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>He attempted to persuade Pope Clement VII to intercede against his own violation of Leviticus, despite earlier using Deuteronomy to win the support of Julius II.</em></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Finally, the question should conclude with some names widely associated with Henry and the giveaway clue:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><em>His chancellors Thomas Wolsey and Thomas More both fell out of his good graces, leading to the martyrdom of More during this man's creation of the Church of England. For 10 points, name this father of Elizabeth I and husband to Catherine Parr, Anne Boleyn, and four other women.</em></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">This question rewards deep knowledge and teaches something interesting to those who didn't know much about Henry VIII before, yet it is still, ultimately, a tossup on a very well known answer which presumably every team can get by the last clue. Such tossups are what we are looking for in your packet submissions. Note also that the tossup, when put together, is noticeably longer than the 6-line cap we will be enforcing on the edited questions – again, please submit your questions this way so that we can edit them into very dense 6-line tossups for the final packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">A question on Henry VIII which relies on things like birth dates or quotations is very boring and is probably not usable, while a question which starts off saying something like "He was a longtime rival of the Papacy and finally took drastic action against it" encourages wild guessing based on minimal knowledge and does not allow players with deeper knowledge of the subject to get the tossup first, and is not usable for those reasons. Similarly, literature questions should rely on plot scenarios and character names first, less so on rote association of titles with authors, in order to reward people who have actually read the books. Myth questions that are on traditional topics such as specific deities should talk about interesting anecdotes involving the figure, not just be a boring list of stock clues like "his symbol was a hexahedron made of onyx, his temple was at Rondopolis, his head looked like a badger's." If such clues are the most well known thing about the figure in question, they do have a place at the end of a tossup, but they should not comprise the whole question. Similar principles apply to all categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Questions on people have a major place in the tournament but should be balanced by questions on works, events, concepts, etc.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="distribution"></a></span></h2>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Distribution: </span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Each submitted packet should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the following distribution:</span>

</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">More specific requirements for each category are as follows.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Literature 5/5</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">American literature: 1/1</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">British literature: 1/1</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">European literature from 500 CE onwards: 1/1</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">World (anything not covered above and not originally written in English): 1/0 or 0/1</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Anything you want, including ancient European literature, more of any category above, or combinations of categories above: 1/2 or 2/1</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Vary lit questions across time periods. The editors understand that a lot of important literature comes from the twentieth century, so feel free to write a large amount of your questions on post-1900 literature, but do not write every single one of your questions on that period, and do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please remember to include several questions on forms other than novels, and include both several questions on authors' general body of work and several questions on specific works.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>History 5/5</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">American history: 1/1 (two different time periods and/or two different historical approaches)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">European, Canadian, and Australian history: 3/3 (out of these six questions, 1 should be on classical history, 1 on British history, and 3 on continental Europe from three different post-classical time periods. The remaining question can be another British history question, another continental Europe question, or a question on Canadian or Australian history. )</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">World history: 1/1 (from two different large areas of the world besides those covered above)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>No more than 4 of your 10 total history questions should be predominately about battles, wars, or people known primarily for their military accomplishments.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Less experienced writers are discouraged from writing tossups on Chinese dynasties, as such questions are difficult to write well. Questions on interesting, unique, and accessible things from East Asian history are appreciated and encouraged as replacements for such dynasty questions.</em></span>

<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Biology 1/1</span></li>

	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Astronomy, earth science/geology, or other science not covered above: 1 question</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don't write a second question on any of the "minor" fields. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Less experienced writers are discouraged from writing tossups on chemical elements, programming languages, or subatomic particles, as such questions are difficult to write well. Within "any science," a maximum of 1 question on the history of science is allowed. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered straight science rather than science history, so you should feel free to write such questions for the relevant category. Questions which straddle the line between biology and chemistry, or chemistry and physics, should be reserved for the "any science" section of the science distribution, so that clear-cut answers can be used in the parts formally marked for the three large branches.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</strong></span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Philosophy: 1/1 (different parts of philosophical history)</span></li>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion (e.g., the Council of Chalcedon) for either history or religion, but don't write about religious history for both categories. A question which could be considered either religion or myth (e.g., Brahma) can be counted as one of your religion questions.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Fine Arts 3/3</strong></span>
<ul>Painting: 1/1 Classical music excluding opera: 1/1 Everything else: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film, or other arts not covered under painting or classical music)</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Please pick one largely visual category and one largely auditory category for your "everything else" subjects – e.g, pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Social Science 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. The two questions should not come from the same field of study. Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Geography 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Also, please do not write both questions on the same area of the world. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</strong></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above, or you can write questions which mix categories here. If you write two trash questions then they should not be from the same general category (e.g. one should be on sports and one on TV, or one on music and one on video games; don't write both on visual media or both on sports).</span></blockquote>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="formatting"></a>Formatting:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that if you don't meet these formatting requirements, we will charge you a <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">penalty</a>, so pay close attention to this section. We are aware that these are very specific requirements and may seem like overkill, but when multiplied by 10 or 20 packets, any slight variations in formatting become a major distraction from the kind of work we really need to be doing on the actual content of the questions, so we would really appreciate everyone following the formatting guidelines religiously.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets must be submitted as some sort of file that can with certainty be opened properly on any computer running Microsoft Word 2002 and can support all of the formatting requirements below. I.e.: submitting them as .doc files, .rtf files, or an exact equivalent to either is strongly preferred. Packets submitted as Word 2007 .docx files are NOT acceptable since those files cannot be opened on older versions of Word. If any of the editors cannot open your packet on the first try, it will be returned and you will have to fix it before it is considered submitted for fee purposes. The filename should be the name of your school, with the letter designating your specific team if your school is sending more than one. USC.doc, UCLA B.doc, or Irvine A.doc are examples of file names we wish to see.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please consult the sample properly <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/acf/formatting-sample.doc">formatted packet</a>. Make your questions look as much like that, aesthetically, as possible, while using the appropriate difficulty level for the particular tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Everything in your packet should be in Times New Roman font of size 10. Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">At the top of the packet, put, in boldface, the tournament name (e.g, <strong>ACF Fall 2013</strong> or <strong>ACF Regionals 2014</strong>), followed on the next line by your school name. Be sure to designate whether it is the A team, B team, etc if your school is sending multiple teams. This should be followed by the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Thus, the top of every packet should look something like this:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>ACF Regionals 2014

<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Toward the end of its first act, one of the characters sings "I Know You Hate Me" after being whipped by the protagonist's wife. A peasant sings "Why Hast Thou Taught Me" to woo the hand of that wife, who is known as Columbine in Act Two. After Beppe sings an ode to Columbine, the protagonist confronts Nedda about Silvio, and when she brushes him off he stabs her, leading Tonio to end the opera with the line "La Commedia Finita." For 10 points, name this opera by Ruggierio Leoncavallo, whose first act ends with the melancholy "Vesti La Giubba" and whose protagonist is a very sad clown.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The last sentence begins with "For 10 points" (not FTP or For ten points) followed by a comma and a space (not by a colon, a dash, or nothing).</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The question text DOES NOT begin with a number or an indentation.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>

<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <em>Le <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dejeuner sur l'Herbe</span></strong></em> [or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Luncheon on the Grass</span></strong></em>; or <em><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Picnic on the Grass</span></strong></em>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Salon des Refuses also featured The White Girl, a painting by this American artist. The painting is also known as his Symphony in White, Number 1.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: James McNeill <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whistler</span></strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Name these places that one might see on a peaceful trip down the Danube, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Danube originates in this wooded mountain area in the far southwest of Germany which extends from Säckingen to Durlach.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Black Forest</span></strong> [or <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Schwarzwald</span></strong>]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] Before emptying into the Black Sea, the river passes through this capital of Slovakia.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bratislava</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] The Rhine-Main-Danube canal allows continuous travel from the Danube to the Rhine Delta, which is found on the North Sea at this city, the second most populous in the Netherlands and the busiest port in the world.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rotterdam</span></strong></span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;">Note that:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The ANSWER: begins a new line, is in all caps, and is followed by a colon and a space.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The required part of the answer is underlined and emboldened.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or other additional information for the moderator are contained within brackets and separated from each other by semicolons.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The titles of overall works such as books, plays, operas, and paintings are italicized, and the title of works contained within larger collections, such as short stories, chapter titles, and songs from operas are contained within quotes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The bonus instruction indicates that the three parts are valued "for 10 points each" and either forms a general instruction for the whole bonus (in which case it ends with a period) or provides a specific clue pertaining to the first part of the bonus (in which case it ends with a colon).</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Examples of the two different types of bonus instructions:</em></span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Name these novels by Charlotte Bronte, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Identify these characters from Plato's Symposium, for 10 points each.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> Name these authors of works set in the Netherlands, for 10 points each.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">He drew a perfect circle to demonstrate his artistic prowess to the Pope. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> The Longmen Grottoes and White Horse Temple are among the religious artifacts found here. For 10 points each:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> According to Hesiod, she is the daughter of Ceto and Phorcys. For 10 points each:</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you write any bonus questions using different point schemes, then make sure to clearly reflect how the points will be awarded in the bonus instruction. If you use a "for the stated points" bonus format, then the value of each part should be indicated both in the brackets and in the text of the bonus parts themselves, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">His essay "Some Remarks on Logical Form" and a preface he wrote for a dictionary for elementary schools are collected in his<em>Philosophical Occasions</em>. For the stated points:</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, name this twentieth-century philosopher of language, whose aphorisms are collected in such books as <em>Culture and Value</em> and<em>Zettel</em>.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Ludwig <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wittgenstein</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, at the end of this first book by Wittgenstein, he asserts that anyone who has understood the book's propositions can now discard them as one would discard a ladder after climbing it.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [10] For 10, Wittgenstein's most important later book is this work which claims that concepts denote "family resemblances" between things and argues that there cannot be a "private language."</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Philosophical Investigations</span></strong></span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [5] For 5, Wittgenstein once threatened this author of The Open Society and its Enemies and proponent of falsificationism with a fireplace poker.</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Karl Raimund <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Popper</span></strong></span></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Standardization of numbers:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. "twenty-two years", "a million dollars" and "fourteen hundred casualties," but "For 10 points" and "1976.") Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><em>Other notes on formatting and grammar:</em></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please delete all of your internal notes from the packet before submitting it. Editors do not want to see stuff like "lit: american (FF)" scattered throughout the document.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Pay attention to parallel structure and the antecedents of pronouns. Some rules of grammar can and should be ignored in order to make your questions pyramidal and concise, but those two are actually very helpful in making your tossups understandable. When you start a sentence with "The king won victories at Battle A, Battle B, and...", you need to conclude it with "Battle C," not "promoted his foreign secretary to vizier." You also need to make sure to avoid stray "this" and "it"s in your questions – if you want to refer back to a previous sentence, use a form of "that" instead to avoid confusing people about the answer.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use any unusual Word templates, and pay attention when converting text from other file formats. If you paste something in, use the "paste as unformatted text" option so it doesn't bring a minefield of crazy style tags with it. There should not be any point in your document where that little template box in Word says anything besides "Normal."</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Manual line breaks, tabs, and that little thing that looks like a degree sign should not be used ever. There should be nothing in your document besides letters, numbers, standard punctuation, italics, bold, underlining, spaces, and paragraph returns.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Remember that using parsimony in non-essential words keeps players from being bored and makes it easier for us to get tossups down to six lines and bonus parts down to two. E.g., "name" instead of "answer questions regarding" in bonus leadins.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Use one inch margins in your packets. This makes it possible for standardized length requirements to be meaningful.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Do not use the subjunctive when the simple past is suitable. Instead of "He would go on to write Bricks Without Straw" , say "He wrote Bricks Without Straw" or "He went on to write Bricks Without Straw." It just sounds better, places the clue more concretely in time, and usually saves words.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="pronunciation"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation Guides:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Pronunciation guides are usually a waste of time, to be honest. Put them in only under the following conditions:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">You actually know how to pronounce the word and are not just guessing.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">The pronunciation guide itself is clear.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">There is a substantial chance that the word will be mispronounced without the guide, and that the mispronunciation of the word will make it unrecognizable to players or mislead them into thinking it is a different clue. E.g.., don't put in guides like "Nabokov (nuh-BAHK-off)" – even though that is correct, no player is going to be confused if they hear the incorrect pronunciation "NAH-buh-kov," so you're just wasting everyone's time putting the guide in.</span></li>
	<li><span style="color:#999999;">Or, if it's an answer, there's a substantial chance that a moderator will not recognize the correct pronunciation because it differs substantially from the appearance of the word on the page. Chinese words transliterated with an "x" standing for an "sh" sound or a "zh" standing for a "j" sound are common pitfalls here, and should receive pronunciation guides in answers.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color:#999999;">If you choose to put in a pronunciation guide under the above circumstances, put it in parentheses, with phonetic spelling and emphasized syllables in all caps, immediately after the relevant word, like so:</span>
<blockquote><span style="color:#999999;">Arthur Rubinstein commissioned a Fantasia by this man, who wrote incidental music to the dramas The Passion and Daybreak. One of his works contains a ritornello in the section "Jota" (HO-tuh). His stage works include the puppet opera The Tale of Master Pedro...</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> [etc, etc]</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> ANSWER: Manuel de Falla</span></blockquote>
<span style="color:#999999;"><strong><a style="color:#999999;" name="wikipedia"></a></strong></span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia reminder:</span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Wikipedia is not a reliable source for meeting the stringent standards of factual accuracy which quizbowl questions must maintain. We will not accept any questions containing clues whose only source is Wikipedia. If you use Wikipedia in your question writing process, then you should cross-check each and every clue gleaned from any Wikipedia article with an established source. It will probably be more time-efficient for you to avoid using Wikipedia at all. If you are having trouble finding good places to look up information for questions, please contact the editor of the tournament you are writing for.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Packets containing questions which are determined to have come solely from Wikipedia will be returned for rewriting and will not count as submitted for purposes of the fee schedule until such questions have been replaced. You will also be <a style="color:#999999;" href="#additional">charged $25</a> on top of your eventual fee for submitting your revised packet.</span>
<h2><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" name="plagiarism"></a>Plagiarism and recycling: </span></h2>
<span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism of any kind in your packet submissions for this tournament is absolutely unacceptable. In general, anything that is considered plagiarism for coursework at your school will be considered plagiarism in your submitted packet. In particular, note that our concept of plagiarism includes but is not limited to lifting wording directly from Wikipedia, Britannica, or any encyclopedia, webpage, book, or other reference source without attribution; and taking questions or parts of questions from previously existing quizbowl packets.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams caught plagiarizing will have their packets rejected and will not be given the opportunity to write a replacement. Such teams will be substantially penalized, as per the notice in the penalties section--i.e., you will either be charged hundreds of dollars, or kicked out of the tournament. We promise you that we WILL catch you if you are plagiarizing. Please make sure that every person writing for your packet is fully aware of the consequences of plagiarism.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Also, your packet may not include any questions that were previously submitted to any tournament whatsoever. Even if your previous questions were not used at the other tournament, you do not know for certain who assisted the editors of the prior tournament or otherwise may have seen your questions, and thus you cannot guarantee that the people who saw your questions are not playing in this tournament. While less serious than plagiarism, question recycling is, likewise, totally prohibited and will result in bad things happening to you, so you should take pains to avoid engaging in this practice.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Thank you for your patience is getting through these long guidelines. They are long and detailed because we want to put on the best tournaments possible, with the best packets possible. Please contact the appropriate tournament editor if you have any further questions.</span>]]></content:encoded>

Please note that, like last year, this requirement also applies to eligible high school teams. Further information can be found at the ACF Packet Submission Guidelines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The submission schedule for this tournament is: (note that these are Saturdays, not Sundays)</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> December 21, 2013: -$50</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"> February 8, 2014: +$50</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> After that: +$10 for each additional day you're late. Teams that are required to submit a packet and do not won't be allowed to play.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit your packet to acfregionals2014@gmail.com; the actual email with attached packet should include the phrase "[name of school + A/B/etc. if applicable) PACKET" in the subject line.

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties:</strong> Be sure to fully read the information contained in the Packet Guidelines. Any cases of incorrect formatting, plagiarism, or prohibited question types will result in hefty fees. The editors also reserve the right to send back any egregious cases to be fixed by the team in question, so be sure to do it right the first time.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please submit all questions/comments/etc. regarding this event to acfregionals2014@gmail.com, or post them in the thread. Running packet list (with deadlines/penalties) will appear below as soon as packets begin to come in.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Distribution:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The distribution for this tournament varies slightly from the required 24/24 distribution on the ACF website. As you can see below, geography and current events have been consolidated into 1/1 and pop-culture has been granted its own 1/1.</span>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF Nationals this year will once again be held at Columbia University in exciting New York City. The tournament will be held on the weekend of Saturday, April 12, and Sunday, April 13, 2014.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">The tournament will convene at or near Hamilton Hall on the Columbia campus at 8:00 AM on Saturday the 12th and run until around 6:00 PM, then finish from 8 AM to about 2 PM on Sunday the 13th.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Jerry Vinokurov</strong> will be the head editor of this tournament, assisted by <strong>Ted Gioia</strong>, <strong>Auroni Gupta</strong>, and <strong>Ryan Westbrook</strong>. <strong>Matt Weiner</strong> will be Tournament Director. Nationals will once again be a fully staffed, efficiently run tournament with a sensible format that remembers to award the <strong>Undergraduate</strong> and <strong>Division II</strong> trophies.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">As it was last year, our recommendation is that teams stay in northern New Jersey (Fort Lee or Secacuus), or Queens, and take the train to the tournament. You will find better pricing on hotels and not have to deal with parking in Manhattan, for which ACF takes no responsibility.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If you have any questions about the logistics of ACF Nationals that you need answered right now, feel free to post here or e-mail Matt Weiner at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com">mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com</a>. We’re looking forward to a healthy field and a great event.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Teams who want to register or submit packets right now can contact Jerry at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:grapesmoker@gmail.com">grapesmoker@gmail.com</a>, but there will be a web-based registration system opening shortly which you should use instead once it becomes available.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet submission, eligibility, and fee schedule:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Information on who is eligible to play ACF tournaments and details regarding packet submission can be found at the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2013-14-packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Fee schedule:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Base fee: $260</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$100 discount: January 12</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$50 discount: January 26</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$25 discount: February 9</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> No penalty: February 23</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$25 penalty: March 2</span>
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$50 penalty: March 9</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">NOTE: <strong>No packets will be accepted later than two weeks before the tournament!</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">If your team brings (fully pays for/does not claim any reimbursement from the tournament for) a qualified moderator, <strong>you will receive a $100 discount</strong>. Qualified moderators are people who can properly complete an ACF Nationals round in thirty minutes. Matt Weiner will be the sole judge of who is qualified, both prior to and during the tournament, and will not award the discount if your staffer fails to meet this requirement. You may, theoretically, claim this discount as many times as possible until your fee reaches $0.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">ACF cannot make this any clearer: After the $50 deadline, <strong>you will owe the editors $10/day</strong>; if you cannot turn in a packet more than two weeks in advance of ACF Nationals, you will not be playing ACF Nationals. This is a hard and fast deadline and there will be no exceptions.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This year, ACF will continue the <strong>50 dollar discount for teams who write at least 20/20 that doesn’t need any major editing and submit their packet by the no penalty deadline</strong>. By major editing, we mean things like having to change many of the clues and/or answerlines and having to fix many grammatical errors.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">We would much rather give out lots of hefty discounts for excellent early packets than rake in money for late ones, so please take advantage of them.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">There is a field cap of 44 teams for this tournament; should more than 44 teams register, a waitlist will be formed, though we do expect a 44-team filed to accommodate this year's level of interest.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Please stay in touch with <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com">Matt</a>, <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:grapesmoker@gmail.com">Jerry</a>, or <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:srferrar@gmail.com">Susan</a> if we are trying to verify your attendance at this event. Dropping of teams who do not communicate about their registration or packet will be done without remorse. While we are not expecting a lot of competition for space in the field, we do need to know who is actually coming to the tournament for several planning purposes, and the editors need time to work on your packets. If we ask you where your packet is or whether the team you said was "interested" two months ago is actually coming, the worst thing you can do is just ignore the e-mail and tell us nothing. Make sure you give valid contact information when you register and check it on at least a weekly basis.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">In 2015, moving Regionals earlier and/or implementing a Regionals-based qualification system will begin. 2014 will be the last ACF Nationals with fully "first-come, first-served"-based entry.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Distribution:</strong></span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Literature: This includes 1/1 American, 1/1 British, 1/1 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre (for instance, please don’t submit 5/5 on French literature or 5/5 poetry).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 History: This includes 1/1 American, 2/2 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please make sure that your questions aren’t all from the same time period or place and aren’t all one type of history (for instance, try not to submit 5/5 political history or 5/5 military history).</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Science: This includes 1/1 Biology, 1/1 Chemistry, 1/1 Physics, and 2/2 Other Science (including areas like Astronomy, Earth Science, Math, and Computer Science). Please don’t write two questions about the same scientific subdistribution.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 Arts: This includes 1/1 Painting, 1/1 Classical Music, and 1/1 Other (including Architecture, Sculpture, Opera, Jazz, Ballet/Dance, Art Film, and Photography). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">3/3 RMP: This includes 1/1 Religion, 1/1 Mythology, and 1/1 Philosophy. Please do not write both religion questions on the same religion or both mythology questions on the same myth system.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Social Science: This includes Psychology, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, and Social Criticism. Please write your tossup and bonus on different areas of social science.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Geography/Current Events: These questions should be about different parts of the world. Geography questions that incorporate cultural and environmental clues instead of purely discussing physical features are particularly welcome.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Other Academic: This includes questions from every preceding category, as well as answers that don’t quite fit into any of the preceding categories.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">Keep in mind that ACF Nationals does not have trash; if you submit any trash questions, they will simply be sent back.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">To reiterate, please vary the distribution of your questions. In past years, we had teams submit packets with both chemistry questions about the same narrow area, to present one example, and it would prevent many headaches if you make sure your questions are reasonably distributed. Also, please remember that while the goal of ACF Nationals is to determine the best team in the nation, writing primarily about extremely difficult topics is not the best way to achieve this, so please try to keep your fellow players in mind while choosing your answer lines.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">This announcement comes with ample time for everyone to start writing their Nationals packets and submit them as early as possible. We want to give you every opportunity to save money on this fantastic event and save us the trouble of having to edit a bunch of packets at the last minute. You should avail yourself of this chance posthaste.</span>

<span style="color:#999999;">All packets should be sent to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:grapesmoker@gmail.com">grapesmoker@gmail.com</a>. If you have any questions about packet writing, you can send them to that email address also. Start writing!</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>High School Eligibility for Discounts at ACF Tournaments</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of 07/16/13, high school teams playing ACF tournaments are ineligible for the "New to College Quizbowl" and "New to ACF" discounts. In the past, these discounts have enabled established high school teams with institutional budgets to pay the editors and hosts nearly nothing while straining host resources, possibly at the expense of other college teams. These discounts are offered to new college teams because one of the main goals of ACF is to encourage serious programs to arise in the collegiate quizbowl circuit. The high school teams who have claimed these discounts in the past are generally top tier teams using ACF tournaments for nationals preparation; though this is legitimate behavior that ACF doesn't mean to discourage, it is one that ACF cannot afford to take a financial hit to subsidize. </p><p>High school teams will continue to be eligible for the short-handed and international team discounts, as well as any they may earn for submitting early packets, providing moderators, and bringing buzzer sets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="#penalties">Penalties</a>

 

<strong>Bidding process
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate head editor. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.

When the editors receive more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: whom they expect to attract more teams, and whom they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance.

Ideally, all bids will be received no later than twelve weeks before the tournament date, and the editors will award bids to hosts in each of the ten regions no later than ten weeks before the tournament date. In reality, only the more active regions are likely to have their bids decided by that time, and it may take some additional weeks before a host can be found in a less active region, so the announcement of bids may be staggered.

<a name="breakdown"></a>
<strong>Financial breakdown between hosts and editors
</strong>The base fee for each “normal” team that participates in your tournament is $135, as described in the packet and fee guidelines. Of this, you can consider $75 the base fee for you, the host, and $60 the base fee for the editors. All packet discounts and penalties (including early/late packet adjustments, and supplementary penalties for formatting or plagiarism) are added to or subtracted from the $60 that is to be paid to the editors: For example, if a team submits their packet at the -$30 deadline, then (ignoring all other discounts), they pay you $105, and ACF will charge you $30 for the editors and let you keep $70, since the $30 comes out of the editors’ share. Similarly, all logistical discounts for buzzers, laptops, staffers, and travel affect your cut: A team that has no packet adjustment and brings 1 buzzer and 1 staffer to the tournament pays $120; ACF will bill you $60 for the editors and let you keep $60, since the logistical discounts come out of your share. 

The following unusual cases will have their fees split up differently: Teams which receive the new quizbowl team discount, teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and house teams.

For teams which receive the “new quizbowl team discount” of $100, you do not owe the editors anything. Any money they do pay is yours. Normally, such teams will pay around $35. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams than from all others.

For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host gets $21 and the editors get $14.

For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you will receive a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.

ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.

<a name="viability"></a>
<strong>Financial viability
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1350. You should expect to spend about $150 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament (the trophy costs will be handed by ACF). 

You should expect $600 to go to the editors, and about $600 as your team’s profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.

<a name="hostreqs"></a>
<strong>Host requirements
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.

Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.

Hosts must use the official ACF rules for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.

Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable “round reports”), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at here. If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.

Unless a host receives explicit permission from the head editor to run fewer, at least ten meaningful games must be offered to all teams. ACF recommends offering at least eleven games.

We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team’s PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.

Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors’ share of the entry fees. ACF will provide trophies to hosts at reasonable cost. ACF will pay the trophy provider directly (including shipping to the host site) and the cost will come out of the host site’s share. The anticipated cost is less than $50 total per host.

<em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams will receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects fewer than four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament two weeks before the tournament, when the trophies are ordered, then the host must inform ACF that it will opt out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies. If the host receives Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, or if there are four or more teams that qualify, the Undergraduate and/or Division II titles must be awarded.

<em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers. If the host opts out of Undergraduate and/or Division II trophies, but it turns out that there are enough teams to award either or both of those titles, hosts must award the titles and make reasonable efforts to award prizes to the winners.

<a name="safety"></a>
<strong>Safety and Misconduct
</strong>ACF’s mission is to provide the best possible experience for players, coaches, and staff, which includes ensuring that issues of safety and misconduct are dealt with fairly and promptly.

ACF strongly recommends that hosts explicitly designate one or more individuals to whom players, coaches, or staff can confidentially address any concerns about safety and misconduct during the tournament, and make the process for doing so clear at the opening meeting. (The designated person or people could simply be the tournament director(s), though ACF recommends having one male and one female person in the role.)

Hosts should, of course, be familiar with the official <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/official-gameplay-rules/" target="_blank">ACF rules</a>, but they should pay particular attention to Section I, “Ethics and Conduct.” In particular, note that “the use of malicious or disrespectful language toward another participant in the match, or the use of epithets insulting a participant’s race, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, etc.” constitutes misconduct, for which you are empowered to eject players from a match. If you encounter a case of misconduct serious enough that ACF should be made aware of it (if, for example, there are indications of a pattern of behavior that might be repeated at other tournaments), you may wish to let the victim know they can fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfndx3DUXgSwpzpweSRLxkErgPlQg4XATE2UaQDJ3EpbpCMPQ/viewform" target="_blank">Misconduct Reporting Form</a>, and/or you can fill it out yourself. Concerns about misconduct can also be addressed to Alex Damisch (alexandra.damisch@gmail.com) or Rob Carson (rob.f.carson@gmail.com). 

<a name="hostpayment"></a>
<strong>Payment from ACF to Hosts
</strong>Starting in 2018-2019, ACF has moved to a host payment system, in which hosts should collect payment from teams, and ACF will collect fees from the hosts. 

After host sites are confirmed, the treasurer will contact each host to provide ACF’s payment information, and to identify any possible stumbling blocks in the payment process (such as vendor or other tax forms that must be filled out, etc.).

Within one week after the tournament, the treasurer will send an invoice to each host site, laying out the packet fees for each team, the split between ACF and the host, and the identities of any teams that have not yet paid and attended that site. The team representatives will be asked to confirm the breakdown and to email any delinquent teams.

After the invoice is confirmed, hosts will be expected to send payment within one month after the tournament.


<a name="nationals"></a>
<strong>For ACF Nationals</strong>
The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.

For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.

If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.

The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.

<a name="penalties"></a>
<strong>Penalties for Egregious Hosting Violations</strong>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Fewer than ten games offered* to each team</td>
<td>$10 per team affected</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delay in paperwork causing egregious delay</td>
<td>flat $50 penalty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failure to play off or award UG/DII titles despite having enough teams or trophies to award either/both of those titles</td>
<td>$50 for each title not awarded</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Failure to keep or post stats</td>
<td>flat $20 penalty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ineligible team plays tournament without prior permission</td>
<td>$100, or ineligible team's entire registration fee, whichever is larger</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Site run in egregious violation of or ignoring the official ACF rules or hosting guidelines</td>
<td>$50 penalty and possible ban from hosting</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
*No penalties will be levied if teams elect to leave early on their own volition, causing schedules to drop below the minimum number of games. Hosts may not, however, encourage teams to leave early.

At the treasurer or head editor's discretion, first-time violations may result in a warning instead of a monetary penalty.

Hosts should talk to the head editor of the tournament, or the ACF treasurer, to bring up any potential issues with the above penalties before they arise. The editor/treasurer may exempt hosts from requirements if it benefits the site.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="content">

Hi quizbowl,This is the official announcement for <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACF Fall 2014</span>. The tournament will be happening the weekend of <strong>11/8/2014</strong>.

<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;">This time is different</span>

Over the last few years, there has been <a class="postlink" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=15109">some</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=12305">desire</a> to see the packet submission system changed. Particularly, we've seen that many teams who submit full packets never see their questions make it to the final set. We would like to see some change on that front.
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;">
What exactly is different?</span>
There are 3 things that are different:

-Full packets are <span style="font-weight:bold;">optional</span>. You will only be <span style="font-weight:bold;">required to submit half-packets</span>.
-The <span style="font-weight:bold;">editors will tell you what distribution</span> your submissions should adhere to. We'll have a clear picture on how this will work pretty soon.
-The discount/penalty schedule is slightly different pursuant to the half-packet requirement.

That's it.
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;">
I have questions about this new initiative. Who do I contact?</span>
Send emails to <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a> with any questions. We will be putting up an FAQ on this thread and on the website in the near future.

If you would prefer a public forum, please see <a class="postlink" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16036">this thread</a> in the Collegiate Discussion section.
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;">
Other details</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">
Editors</span>
Gautam and Gaurav Kandlikar will be overseeing the production of the set.

Most of the editing will be done by <span style="font-weight:bold;">Jordan Brownstein</span> of the University of Maryland, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Jacob Reed</span> of Yale, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Max Schindler</span> of UChicago, <span style="font-weight:bold;">Richard Yu</span> of WUStL, and <span style="font-weight:bold;">Ben Zhang</span> of Columbia University.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Hosting</span>

Hosts finalized: None

Host bids sought: New England / Mid-Atlantic / South / Texas-Area / Great Lakes / Eastern Canada / North / Midwest / California / Northwest / United Kingdom

We are currently soliciting hosts for all the above regions. Hosting is a good way to raise money and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you are interested in hosting, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a>.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Packet Submission</span>

Any team with <span style="font-weight:bold;">at least one person</span> on it who played <span style="font-weight:bold;">a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2013 is required to submit a packet</span>. High school players are included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams.

Please reference <a class="postlink" href="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/b2402abc-239f-481b-93c8-de4e6819e60a/0">this flowchart</a> for the packet-submission guidelines. The links in the diagram are clickable. If you have questions on thesubmission guidelines, email them to <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a> and we'll clarify.

Please submit packets to <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a> and use “ACF Fall 2014: [Team Name]” in the subject line.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Submission schedule</span>

Please refer to the below submission schedule:
<img src="http://cdn.img42.com/30e8a8a2b75eb0c8110f27a5010110c0.png" alt="Image" />

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Fees</span>:

Base fee: $120 for one team from a school, $240 for two teams from a school, etc.
Buzzer systems*: -$5 each
Staffers: -$10 each No maximum.
Laptop: -$5 each Maximum 1 per team.
Travel: -$10 per 200 miles traveled one way
International**: -$20
New to ACF teams***: -$25
New quizbowl teams****: -$75

* No discount for broken buzzers; no maximum.
** For teams representing schools located in a different country than the tournament host.
*** For schools which haven't played an ACF tournament between September 2012 and August 2014, and have no one on the team(s) claiming this discount who played those tournaments for another school.
**** For schools which did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament since September 2012, and have no one on the team(s) claiming this discount who played those tournaments for another school. May be combined with new ACF team discount for a total new-team discount of $100.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Packet Penalties</span>

We have <a class="postlink" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2013-14-packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">clear guidelines</a> on what your submissions can or cannot be, with information on penalties for flouting the guidelines. Please follow them. We will enforce penalties.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Friendly Reminders</span>

Please <span style="font-weight:bold;">follow the processes and guidelines</span> laid out by the editors and ACF.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Don't talk about your submitted questions</span> with anyone else until the editors tell you it's okay.
Please <span style="font-weight:bold;">follow past iterations of ACF Fall</span>, eg. the <a class="postlink" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/334/">2008</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/82/">2009</a>, <a class="postlink" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/457/">2012</a> versions, for an idea of what your submissions should be like.
If you think a particular topic you want to write on is too hard, it probably is. Write on something easier.
If you have any other questions, please give us a holler at <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a>.
Ciao

Update: Link to flowchart on the packet submission process has been added.

New stuff is in green.</span><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%;">Qualification system</span><br />Starting this year, participation in ACF Regionals in January will be the major component of the qualification procedure for ACF Nationals in April. Teams will be ranked based on their performance at Regionals according to a publicly-available &quot;A-value&quot;, with some provisions for host bids granted at ACF's discretion and autobids for being the overall winner or Undergraduate champion of a sufficiently large ACF Regionals site. See the post below from ACF Communications Officer Stephen Eltinge for further details.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Editors:</span><br />Head Editor: Matthew Jackson<br />Co-Editors: Sarah Angelo (VCU), Tommy Casalaspi (UVA), Trevor Davis (Alberta), Stephen Liu (Stanford), Sriram Pendyala (Harvard)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Hosts:</span><br />Note that we are now actively seeking hosts in most regions - please contact us at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:acfregionals2015@gmail.com">acfregionals2015@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> if you're interested. Sarah Angelo will be handling this year's host requests from the above email address. Bidding will be open until November 2nd. Editors have preference here, so their schools may be granted mirrors before the bidding deadline if their school wants to host for their region. The regions listed below are rough guidelines; bid if you're interested and we'll try to make the most practical distribution of mirrors possible even if the eventual set of sites is different from the one listed. Registration forms will become available as the tournament gets closer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Canada/Niagara</span>: McMaster<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Northeast</span>: Harvard<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mid-Atlantic</span>: UVA<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Southeast</span>: Vanderbilt<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Texas/Gulf Coast</span>: Rice<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Lower Midwest</span>: Mizzou<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Great Lakes</span>: Northern Illinois<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ohio/Michigan</span>: Michigan State<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">California</span>: Stanford<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Packet Submission:</span><br />Every team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2013 is required to submit a packet in order to play in Regionals. Please note that, like last year, this requirement also applies to eligible high school teams. Further information can be found at the ACF Packet Submission Guidelines. <span style="color:#008000;">Unlike this year's ACF Fall, 2015 ACF Regionals will not allow teams to submit half-packets or partial packets.</span><br /><br />The submission schedule for this tournament is as follows. In order to meet any particular deadline, your packet must be in our inbox by 11:59 pm PST on the stated day. (Note that these dates are Saturdays, not Sundays.)<br /><br />No packets before November 1, please.<br /><br />November 29: -$50<br />December 13: -$25 (-$50 for optional packets)<br />December 27: no penalty (-$25 for optional packets)<br />January 3: +$25 (optional packets do not receive penalties)<br />January 10: +$50<br />After that: +$10 for each additional day you're late. Teams that are required to submit a packet and do not submit one by January 17, 2015 will not be allowed to play ACF Regionals. <br /><br /><span style="color:#008000;">Note: Though these deadlines are earlier overall due to the shift of ACF Regionals' place in the schedule, participating teams should take note that this year's earliest submission deadline corresponds to Thanksgiving break and the no-penalty deadline corresponds to Christmas break. </span><br /><br />Please submit your packet to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:acfregionals2015@gmail.com">acfregionals2015@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->; the actual email with attached packet should include the phrase &quot;[name of school + A/B/etc. if applicable) PACKET&quot; in the subject line. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution:</span> <br /><br />The distribution for this tournament <span style="color:#008000;"> will be the same as last year's ACF Regionals, which varies slightly from the required 24/24 distribution on the ACF website.</span> <br /><br />Literature 5/5 <span style="color:#008000;">(Note that ACF only requires 1 world literature question in this whole 5/5)</span><br />History 5/5<br />Science 5/5<br />Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3<br />Fine Arts 3/3<br />Social Science 1/1<br />Geography/Current Events: 1/1<br />Pop Culture: 1/0 or 0/1<br /><span style="color:#008000;">Your Choice</span> / Any Academic Category: 1/0 or 0/1<br /><br />Teams who clearly fail to fill out the distribution properly will have their packets returned to them and be instructed to resubmit a properly-distributed packet.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Packet Penalties</span><br /><br />We have clear guidelines on what your submissions can or cannot be, with information on penalties for flouting the guidelines. Please follow them. Cases of incorrect formatting, or prohibited question types will result in fees; in particular, plagiarism will be penalized with hefty fees and possible sanctions. <span style="color:#008000;">The editors also reserve the right to send back any egregious cases to be fixed by the team in question rather than charging fees</span>, so be sure to do it right the first time.<br /><br />A few friendly reminders:<br /><br /><ul><li>Please <span style="font-weight:bold;">follow the processes and guidelines</span> laid out by the editors and ACF.</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Don't talk about your submitted questions</span> with anyone else until the editors tell you it's okay. If your school is sending multiple teams (A, B, etc.), each team must keep the contents of its own packet confidential within itself. If sites of ACF Regionals 2015 are run on a date other than January 24, 2015, we will set up a private subforum for discussion and expect teams to hold off on public discussion until the last site is completed.</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Please follow recent past iterations of ACF Regionals</span>, particularly the 2011, 2012, and 2014 versions, for an idea of what your submissions should look like. </li><li><span style="font-weight:bold;">If you think a particular topic you want to write on is too hard, it probably is.</span> In general, err on the side of writing something easier. Take a look at Andrew Hart's regular difficulty primer on the ACF website for more guidance.</li><li><span style="color:#008000;">I will be maintaining a <span style="font-weight:bold;">7-line cap on tossup length and a 2-line cap on bonus part length in the final set</span>. While it is okay to submit questions which are somewhat longer than the expected final length, with the idea that editors will cut them down, don't go overboard. If you're submitting tossups that are longer than nine lines or so for this tournament, you're doing it wrong.</span> </li></ul><span style="font-weight:bold;">Fees</span><br /><br />Base fee: $120 for one team from a school, $240 for two teams from a school, etc.<br />Buzzer systems*: -$5 each <br />Staffers: -$10 each No maximum.<br />Travel: -$10 per 200 miles traveled one way<br />International**: -$20<br />New to ACF teams***: -$25<br />New quizbowl teams****: -$75 <br /><br />* No discount for broken buzzers; no maximum.<br />** For teams representing schools located in a different country than the tournament host.<br />*** For schools which haven't played an ACF tournament between September 2012 and August 2014; <span style="color:#008000;">having anyone on your team(s) who has played an ACF tournament prior to the 2014-15 competition year invalidates this discount.</span><br />**** For schools which did not send a team to any regular collegiate academic tournament since September 2012; <span style="color:#008000;">having anyone on your team(s) who has played a regular collegiate quizbowl tournament prior to the 2014-15 competition year invalidates this discount.</span> May be combined with new ACF team discount for a total new-team discount of $100.<br /><br /><span style="color:#008000;">[The laptop discount has been eliminated. Staffers are expected either to bring a device with them which is capable of displaying Word documents and PDFs, unless they get explicit confirmation from hosts that the site they are attending will be using printed paper packets.]<br /><br />As with other ACF tournaments, payment will be centralized. Teams will pay their entry fee directly to ACF prior to playing the tournament, and ACF will pay host fees out thereafter. For more questions about payment, contact ACF treasurer Jerry Vinokurov. </span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Further questions?</span><br /><br />Please submit all questions/comments/etc. regarding this event to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:acfregionals2015@gmail.com">acfregionals2015@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->, or post them in this thread (i.e. do not send to personal email addresses). A running packet list (with deadlines/penalties) will appear below as soon as packets begin to come in.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Running Packet List:</span></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>ACF Formatting Guidelines</title>
  <link>http://acf-quizbowl.com/archives/acf-formatting-guidelines/</link>
  <pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2014 03:07:45 +0000</pubDate>
  <dc:creator>acfquizbowl</dc:creator>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">http://acf-quizbowl.com/?page_id=833</guid>
  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A friendly reminder: ACF editors will charge a </em><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-packet-submission-guidelines/#dp"><em>penalty</em></a><em> if you do not meet the guidelines below. So pay close attention to this section. </em>
<h2>Content Formatting</h2>
<h3>Fonts, Margins, etc.</h3>
Your submitted packet should be in Size 10 Times New Roman font. The margins should be 1 inch on all sides. The lines should be single spaced and spacing between paragraphs should be 0pt.

<em>Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</em>
<h3>Packet Header</h3>
In the first two lines, place the following in bold text:

&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt;
Packet by &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt; (Player1, Player2, Player3, etc.)

You should include the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Eg.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>ACF Regionals 2014
Packet by Reno Tech B (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong></p>

<h3>Tossup formatting</h3>
Tossups should be 6-7 lines in length, with the occasional tossup going into the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> line. The last sentence of a tossup should begin with “For 10 points” (and not “FTP” or “F10P”) followed by a comma and a space.

<em>Do not number or indent your tossups</em>. <em>Do not include power-marks in your tossups</em>.
<h3>Bonus formatting</h3>
Bonuses should have parts that are two lines long, with an occasional part that goes into the third line. Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Bonus leadin</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The first line of a bonus, the leadin, should include a description of the point values for the bonus parts. i.e., if it is a 3-part bonus, it should say “for 10 points each.” Else, it should say, “for the stated number of points.”</p>

<h3>Answer-line formatting</h3>
The answer for any tossup or bonus part should be in its own line. The line should begin with the text “ANSWER: “; that is, the word “ANSWER” in all caps, followed by a colon and a space.

The required part of an answer should be <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined and bolded</span></strong>. If the answer is the title of a work like a book, a play, an opera, a painting, a film, etc. <em>it should be italicized</em>. If it is something contained within a larger collection, e.g. a short story, a chapter, a song, etc. it should be contained within quotes.

Any instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or additional instructions for moderators should be contained within brackets.
<h3>Standardization of numbers</h3>
To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. “twenty-two years”, “a million dollars” and “fourteen hundred casualties,” but “For 10 points” and “1976.”)

Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.
<h3>Other notes on formatting and grammar</h3>
Please delete all internal notes and conversations from the packet before submitting it.

If there is a note that you would like to convey to the editors, please add it as a comment using MS Word, or leave a line before or after the question.

<em>Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</em>

<em>Avoid using special characters if possible</em>. Characters with accents and other diacritical marks are okay.
<h2>Organizing your packet</h2>
Group your questions by category. Tossups should appear before bonuses. The ordering of the categories does not matter. Within a category, the ordering of sub-categories doesn’t matter, either.

Take a look at this packet our editor Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.

<strong><em>Do NOT randomize your packet. We will return your packet to you if you submit a randomized packet.</em></strong>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>For up-to-date information on ACF Nationals 2015, please visit the announcement on the hsquizbowl forums: <a href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=17110">link</a></strong>. NOTE: Defer to the thread above if there are any discrepancies between the announcement below and the information in the thread!

<strong>The list of teams qualified for ACF Nationals 2015 can be found <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/acf-regionals-2015/2015-acf-regionals-a-values/">here</a>.</strong>

This is the announcement for this year’s Academic Competition Federation national championship tournament.<br /><br />ACF Nationals this year will be held at the University of Michigan in colorful Ann Arbor, MI. The tournament will be held on the weekend of Saturday, April 18, and Sunday, April 19, 2015.<br /><br />The tournament will most likely convene and be entirely held within the Mason/Angell/Haven complex of buildings on the Central Campus. Full details about buildings used will be made available shortly, but this is where most UM tournaments are held.<br /><br />All teams will need to check in by 8:00 AM on Saturday the 18th and be prepared to play until at least 7:00 PM. We will finish from 8 AM to about 2 PM on Sunday the 19th.<br /><br />Ryan Westbrook will be the head editor of this tournament, assisted by Rob Carson, Ike Jose, and Billy Busse. Matt Weiner will be Tournament Director. Nationals will once again be a fully staffed, efficiently run tournament with a sensible format that remembers to award the Undergraduate and Division II trophies.<br /><br />There are many affordable hotels in the area, including within walking distance. On-street parking is sometimes available and there is a pay garage close to the tournament site. Detroit Metropolitan Airport is about thirty miles east of Ann Arbor and is the recommended airport for those flying in. There is a bus route from the airport to the town that you can plan to use if not renting a car, and there are also taxi services.<br /><br />Feel free to post here if you need any more specific travel advice from Michigan residents. Post here or e-mail Matt Weiner at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com">mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com</a><!-- e --> with tournament operation inquiries. We’re looking forward to a healthy field and a great event.<br /><br />There will be a web-based registration system opening shortly which you should use instead once it becomes available.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Packet submission, eligibility, and fee schedule:</span><br /><br />Information on who is eligible to play ACF tournaments and details regarding packet submission can be found at the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-packet-submission-guidelines/" class="postlink">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a>.<br /><br />This tournament will use the qualification system announced and discussed earlier in this thread. The packet deadlines have been adjusted such that everyone will know where they stand with regards to qualification before the first deadline arrives. The issue of submitting speculative packes is now moot.<br /><br />Fee schedule:<br /><br />Base fee: $260<br />-$100 discount:<span style="font-weight:bold;">February 1</span><br />-$50 discount: <span style="font-weight:bold;">February 15</span><br />-$25 discount: <span style="font-weight:bold;">March 1</span><br />No penalty:<span style="font-weight:bold;">March 15</span><br />+$25 penalty: <span style="font-weight:bold;">March 29</span><br />+$50 penalty: <span style="font-weight:bold;">April 5</span><br /><br />After the $50 deadline, you will owe the editors an additional $10/day up until the point when they choose to drop you from the tournament. If you are required to submit a packet and you do not do so by April 5, you risk either being dropped from the field or charged a lot of money, at the discretion of the editors; the only way to be sure to avoid this is to get your packet in by April 5.<br /><br />If your team brings (fully pays for/does not claim any reimbursement from the tournament for) a qualified moderator, you will receive a $100 discount. Qualified moderators are people who can properly complete an ACF Nationals round in thirty minutes. I, Matt Weiner, will be the sole judge of who is qualified, both prior to and during the tournament, and will not award the discount if your staffer fails to meet this requirement. You may, theoretically, claim this discount as many times as possible until your fee reaches $0.<br /><br />This year, ACF will continue the $50 dollar discount for teams who write at least 20/20 that doesn’t need any major editing and submit their packet by the no penalty deadline. By major editing, we mean things like having to change many of the clues and/or answerlines and having to fix many grammatical errors.<br /><br />We would much rather give out lots of hefty discounts for excellent early packets than rake in money for late ones, so please take advantage of them.<br /><br />There is a field cap of 44 teams for this tournament, and the qualification system is in place. After auto-qualifiers are determined, teams will be offered spots in the tournament in the order of their A-value. If every team who played ACF Regionals, and thus has an A-value, is offered a spot in the Nationals field and there are still fewer than 44 teams registered, then any team eligible to play ACF will be allowed to fill the remaining spots on a first-come, first-served basis. Any team who is required to write a packet under the packet submission deadlines must do so to in order to play and will be subject to the above fee schedule,  regardless of how or when the team enters the field.<br /><br />Please stay in touch with me or other ACF members if we are trying to verify your attendance at this event.<br /><br />Dropping of teams who<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> do not communicate</span> about their registration or packet will be done without remorse -- this is a separate issue from late packets and comes down to the possibility that some other team may wish to take your spot and we need to recruit adequate staff and plan a schedule for the event. If we send you an e-mail asking if the team you said was &quot;interested&quot; two months ago is actually coming, and you ignore the e-mail and tell us nothing for several days on end, we may have to assume you are not coming and forfeit your spot in the field. Make sure you give valid contact information when you register and check it on at least a weekly basis.<br /><br />Distribution:<br /><br />5/5 Literature: This includes 1/1 American, 1/1 British, 1/1 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre (for instance, please don’t submit 5/5 on French literature or 5/5 poetry).<br /><br />5/5 History: This includes 1/1 American, 2/2 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please make sure that your questions aren’t all from the same time period or place and aren’t all one type of history (for instance, try not to submit 5/5 political history or 5/5 military history).<br /><br />5/5 Science: This includes 1/1 Biology, 1/1 Chemistry, 1/1 Physics, and 2/2 Other Science (including areas like Astronomy, Earth Science, Math, and Computer Science). Please don’t write two questions about the same scientific subdistribution.<br /><br />3/3 Arts: This includes 1/1 Painting, 1/1 Classical Music, and 1/1 Other (including Architecture, Sculpture, Opera, Jazz, Ballet/Dance, Art Film, and Photography). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre.<br /><br />3/3 RMP: This includes 1/1 Religion, 1/1 Mythology, and 1/1 Philosophy. Please do not write both religion questions on the same religion or both mythology questions on the same myth system.<br /><br />1/1 Social Science: This includes Psychology, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, and Social Criticism. Please write your tossup and bonus on different areas of social science.<br /><br />1/1 Geography/Current Events: These questions should be about different parts of the world. Geography questions that incorporate cultural and environmental clues instead of purely discussing physical features are particularly welcome.<br /><br />1/1 Other Academic: This includes questions from every preceding category, as well as answers that don’t quite fit into any of the preceding categories.<br /><br />Keep in mind that ACF Nationals does not have trash; if you submit any trash questions, they will simply be sent back.<br /><br />To reiterate, please vary the distribution of your questions. In past years, we had teams submit packets with both chemistry questions about the same narrow area, to present one example, and it would prevent many headaches if you make sure your questions are reasonably distributed. Also, please remember that while the goal of ACF Nationals is to determine the best team in the nation, writing primarily about extremely difficult topics is not the best way to achieve this, so please try to keep your fellow players in mind while choosing your answer lines.<br /><br />All packets should be sent to Ryan Westbrook's retro hipster email address, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:cryobristow@aol.com">cryobristow@aol.com</a><!-- e -->. If you have any questions about packet writing, you can send them to that email address also.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="color:#800000;"><strong><i><span style="color:#ff0000;">NOTE: You are currently looking at a version of the ACF rules which is obsolete due to a thorough rules update which took place in Summer 2016. The version below exists for archival / historical purposes only, and should NOT be referenced for any official functions. The new rule set can be found at <a style="color:#ff0000;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/official-gameplay-rules">http://acf-quizbowl.com/official-gameplay-rules</a>.</span>
</i></strong></span></h1>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="color:#800000;"><em>Last updated 24 June 2015</em></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><b>The following is a comprehensive rule for establishing eligibility at either high school or college tournaments.</b> For a printable PDF copy of the official ACF rules, <a style="color:#800000;" href="https://github.com/gauravsk/acf/raw/master/rules/acf_rules.pdf">click here</a>.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>ACF has announced updates to its eligibility rules, which will go into effect in Academic Year 2015-16. Please check the <a style="color:#800000;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=17509">announcement</a> for details.</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>ACF RULES FOR GAMEPLAY, TOURNAMENT EXECUTION, AND PLAYER ELIGIBILITY</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;">These rules are © 2007 the Academic Competition Federation. Some portions of these rules were, with permission, based on the copyrighted rules of the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence. Any tournament may use these rules without owing any financial obligation to the Academic Competition Federation, or any other obligation except for giving credit to the Academic Competition Federation as the author of these rules. Tournaments may modify these rules as long as such modifications, and their source, are clearly noted.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>A. Tournament Participants and Roles</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> Every room will have a moderator who presents the packet of questions to the teams. The scorekeeper records the activity of the game on an official scoresheet. The tournament director may appoint additional officials to help manage the competition. A moderator may act as his own scorekeeper, or, if both teams consent, may ask a player or spectator to keep the official score.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> A team member is an eligible individual on the roster of a particular team. See section C for eligibility rules.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> The team captain is a member of the team who is in the game and is responsible for giving answers when prompted on bonus questions, as described in rule F.1. The team captain is self-designated at the start of each game and may change this designation to another player in the game before the start of any tossup. If the team captain is substituted out, he must indicate, upon departing, who the new captain is. Especially at the high school level, some or all of the team captain’s functions may actually be governed by the coach, as described in rule A.5.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> The tournament director is the self-designated on-site organizer of a particular tournament and has final discretion in all decisions about protests and behavioral sanctions. For ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, and ACF Nationals, the “editors” of a tournament are the individuals assigned to coordinate the production of the packet set, which, for Fall and Regionals, is then distributed to the tournament directors at various sites to be played. For all other collegiate tournaments using these rules, and for all high school tournaments using these rules, the functions assigned to the “editors” are instead the responsibility of the tournament director.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> On a team with more than four players on its roster, the team members are responsible for selecting their own lineup for each game and deciding on substitutions. Only players in the game may file protests. Players are free to follow the instruction of any outside coach or other person in making these decisions, and should be given reasonable accommodation by moderators to consult with their coaches over possible protests. When using these rules for high school tournaments, a large or complete degree of control by coaches over the team’s decisions is expected in some areas. Local traditions about the role of the coach should be followed.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>B. General Rules of Conduct</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> All teams, staff, and spectators must adhere to the highest standard of ethics. Participants are expected to compete in a civil, sportsmanlike manner.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> Cheating will not be tolerated. Any team member or spectator found to be party to cheating will be expelled from the competition immediately. At the discretion of the tournament director, the results of games in which cheating was found to occur may be changed to forfeits. All participants share a responsibility to report instances where cheating may have occurred and are expected to cooperate fully and honestly in investigations of potential cheating.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> Any player, staffer, or spectator may be ejected from the tournament for one egregious behavioral offense, such as discriminatory language, cheating, fighting, or destruction of the host institution’s property; or for a pattern of lesser offenses, as defined and warned by the tournament director, over the course of the day. The tournament director has sole and non-appealable discretion over ejections.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>C. Player and Team Eligibility</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> For high school tournaments, or high school teams competing in collegiate tournaments, eligibility may be governed by a state association of athletic directors, quizbowl coaches, or so forth. When applicable, eligibility rules put forth by those groups will take the place of rules C.2 through C.8.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2. </strong>The following is a comprehensive rule for establishing eligibility at either high school or college tournaments.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.1.</strong> For high school tournaments, players must be enrolled at the school for which they are playing, or have graduated in the same academic year that the tournament is being held.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.2</strong>. For collegiate tournaments, players may establish eligibility in one of three ways, labelled Rule A, Rule B, and Rule C below. For purposes of these rules, "class" means a college-level class taken, for credit, at the institution at which the player is attempting to establish eligibility. "Taking" a class below means that, on the date of the tournament, the player is currently enrolled in that class, or has completed that class for credit earlier in the academic year. Summer courses are considered part of the preceding academic year for this rule only, but not for any other rules. High schools are not eligible to enter teams in ACF collegiate events, but players in high school may be able to establish eligibility for a collegiate institution under Rule C below.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.3.</strong> Rule A. Any person who meets ACF's definition of an "undergraduate" under Rule C.11 on the date of the year's ACF Fall tournament, and has not been granted a BA or equivalent degree prior to the academic year for which eligibility is being sought, may establish eligibility at a postsecondary institution by:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>a)</strong> taking any class for which credit at the institution is offered, explicitly including but not limited to traditional classroom instruction, distance learning, or dual-enrollment classes offered at and/or through high schools, or</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>b)</strong> doing any equivalent academic work for which credit or specific satisfaction of a degree requirement is actually earned, including but not limited to supervised independent study, work placement, or internship.</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>c)</strong> the class or equivalent academic work must be undertaken during or before the first tournament for which eligibility is sought.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.4. </strong>Rule B. A person who does not meet ACF's definition of "undergraduate" under Rule C.11 on or before the date of the year's ACF Fall tournament, or has been granted a BA or equivalent degree prior to the current academic year for which eligibility is being sought, or both, cannot claim eligibility under Rule A. Such a student is eligible to play for a postsecondary institution if he or she is in a specific degree program for a degree granted by that institution.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>a)</strong> A "degree program" is defined for this purpose as the required course of study offered by a postsecondary institution for a specific bachelor's, master's, doctoral, or equivalent degree to any such as a B.S., J.D., or M.Div. A second bachelor's degree is acceptable as a "degree program" for this purpose. Professional certification programs, community college associate's degrees, and equivalent degrees do not qualify under this rule, and such students must meet the Rule C standard instead.</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>b)</strong> A student who is in good standing and making academic progress at any above-defined program during the academic year for which eligibility is being sought will be eligible without regard to any further considerations. The class or other component of the program being cited as "academic progress" must be undertaken during or before the first tournament for which eligibility is being sought.</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>c)</strong> Graduate students whose only remaining work is the completion of a thesis are explicitly eligible under Rule B, so long as the university still considers them to be a full-time graduate student in good standing making academic progress.</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>d)</strong> "ABD" students who are still permitted to submit a thesis in the future, but are not making academic progress at the time, are not eligible for ACF unless they meet one of the other routes to eligibility.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.5.</strong> Rule C. A person who does not meet the requirements for eligibility under Rule A or Rule B must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>a)</strong> The student must be taking a total of at least three full-credit courses during the year, all through the institution for which eligibility is being sought, and all at or before the first ACF tournament being played under the eligibility thus earned. For example, a student wishing to play ACF Fall must be taking three or more classes in the fall, but a student wishing to play ACF Regionals need only take a total of three classes between the fall and spring.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>a1)</strong> A "full-credit course" is a course offered for the ordinary amount of credit that a "normal" course, expected to be taken by undergraduates with junior or senior standing at the university, earns. For example, a university at which a semester-long upperclassman-level class ordinarily earns three credits, this means a three-credit or more course. Because universities often count credits differently or offer more credits than standard for certain types of classes, this is defined with reference to each specific university rather than as a set amount of "credits" globally. A standard course for credit at a graduate school, professional school, professional certificate program, high school dual-enrollment program, or other program for credit qualifies as a "full-credit course."</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>b)</strong> The courses may be in classroom, online, etc., but to establish eligibility under Rule C, they must be courses only. They cannot be substituted for with independent study, internships, or other non-class academic work.</span>
<span style="color:#800000;"> <strong>c)</strong> The ACF eligibility committee may investigate students seeking eligibility under Rule C to determine whether they have a legitimate, non-quizbowl-based, academic-path reason for being enrolled in classes. If such students are found to be merely trying to gain technical eligibility, or to be "taking classes for its own sake," then they will be ruled ineligible. Students in this situation must have a specific academic goal in mind for taking their classes to be eligible for ACF.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.6.</strong> The ACF eligibility committee consists of the head editors of ACF Fall, Regionals, and Nationals, or their designated proxies, who must be Full ACF members. This committee is the final authority on any question of eligibility. The following parties may petition the committee: any player regarding their own eligibility or the eligibility of any other player, any coach or other team adviser, or any director of an ACF tournament. The committee may be petitioned both before an ACF tournament and up to three weeks after the conclusion of the event. Players who question their own eligibility must petition the committee a reasonable amount of time before the tournament that they wish to play. If the committee retroactively declares a player ineligible, sanctions are available under Rule C.8. Once the committee rules a player eligible or ineligible, that decision will stand for the entire competition year unless the educational circumstances of the player in question change, in which case the committee may be asked to re-rule. Decisions of the committee require at least two of the three votes. The ACF Eligibility Committee reserves the right to investigate or remove someone's eligibility to play ACF tournaments or play for a particular school if the spirit of the rules, which is generally defined as "college quizbowl is for college students," is not met.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.7.</strong> Holding any prior degree from any institution will not, in and of itself, render an otherwise eligible player ineligible. The taking of minimal course loads for the sole purpose of retaining eligibility at an institution that the player would not otherwise be attending is prohibited. Determining whether this is taking place is at the sole discretion of the eligibility committee; players who do not meet the letter of the eligibility rules laid out here but who believe that their circumstances merit consideration should apply to this committee before attempting to register for any ACF tournaments. Sanctions for players discovered to be ineligible are discussed in rule C.8.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> Players may not participate in tournaments held earlier in the academic year than their classes begin.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> Players may play for any institution for which they are eligible at any tournament. Players need not apply for special dispensation to play for a second school during a particular academic year if they are able to establish eligibility at the second institution. A player may represent only one institution at any given tournament.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> Teams may consist of individuals from only one school and may not include individuals enrolled at other schools or nonstudents.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.1.</strong> Players at graduate institutions which are affiliated with a state’s university system in general but with no particular undergraduate college may choose to form their own team or to play for any school in the relevant university system, though they may not switch teams mid-year except as provided in rule C.4. The ACF eligibility committee must approve any instance in which such a student plays for another school in the relevant university system.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.2.</strong> With the exception of the case in C.5.1, teams composed of players from multiple institutions within the same university system are not allowed.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>6.</strong> At the high school level, teams including students from more than one school may sometimes be permitted on an exhibition basis, as determined by the tournament director. Nonstudents—individuals who are not, were not, and are not planning to be secondary school students in the academic year that the tournament takes place—are never permitted to play in high school tournaments.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.</strong> Any accredited real-world educational institution that offers recognized post-seconday degrees may participate in any collegiate-level ACF tournament. This includes all sorts of post-secondary institutions, such as service academies and community colleges. Institutions with the word “online” in their names are not eligible. At high school tournaments, only high schools and, if in accordance with local traditions and the policy of the tournament director, middle schools, may participate.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.</strong> If a player is determined to be ineligible prior to an event, the sole penalty for that player will be disqualification from playing at that event on the team for which he is ineligible. He will still be allowed to play the event in question for any other team for which he meets the eligibility requirements of these rules, and his eligibility for future events will not be affected. A team which is discovered after an event to have used one or more ineligible players may be required to retroactively forfeit games involving that player and any titles dependent on the results of those particular games, but no other penalty will apply.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>9.</strong> An individual may play for only one team during a tournament; e.g., there is no switching from an “A” to “B” team during the day. Players must register as being on one team’s roster or another at the start of the tournament—even if a player, on a team with more than four players on its roster, does not actually play for the “A” team in some round, he is still on the “A” team’s roster for the entire day and cannot play for the “B” team in a later round.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>10.</strong> A team’s overall roster may consist of between one and six players, inclusive, over the course of the tournament. No more than four players may play at any one time. Substitutions during the game are governed by rule D.8.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>11.</strong> For collegiate tournaments which recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of "undergraduate" status, an "undergraduate" player is a player who did not receive a BA or equivalent or higher degree prior to the academic year in which the tournament is taking place AND meets the following rule:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>11.1.</strong> The player first enrolled in a collegiate program in an academic year five or fewer years prior to July 31 of the year in which the tournament is taking place. "Enrolled in a collegiate program" means enrollment at a college, university, community college, or equivalent for the purpose of taking classes toward a BA, AA, or equivalent degree, and does not include any enrollment occurring before the player has obtained a high school degree, such as post-secondary high school programs. For purposes of this rule, the date of enrollment is the school's first day of classes in the first period in which the player has enrolled, excluding summer term classes. If a particular institution's fall academic calendar begins before August 1, the player's date of enrollment will be set as August 1. Leap days have no bearing on the five-year period; for example, July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2020 is considered five years and zero days.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>12.</strong> For collegiate tournaments that recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of “Division II” status, a “Division II” player is:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>12.1.</strong> Any freshman or sophomore (i.e. first- or second-year) player (measured by time in school, not by credits)</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>13.</strong> The tournament editors will determine what constitutes a "collegiate" or "academic" quizbowl tournament whenever the eligibility rules require such a distinction.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>D. Questions and Match Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> A tossup is a question for which competitors must signal in, using a lockout buzzer device, before answering. Conferring among team members on tossup questions, as defined in section E.5., is not allowed. A correct tossup answer is worth 10 points and, except in sudden-death tiebreaker situations, earns the reading of a bonus. An incorrect answer which is given before the reading of the question is complete and is the first buzz on the question loses 5 points. Incorrect answers after the other team has answered, or after the question is completely read, do not change the score.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> A bonus question is a series of question parts given to an entire team to answer. Conferring is allowed and encouraged. Usually, the captain submits the team’s answer for each part, though any player may give the team’s official answer by clearly directing an answer at the moderator; there is no need for the captain to formally “defer.” All bonuses are worth a total of 30 points and will consist of at least two parts with at least three total answers. Each bonus part must be answered after it is read.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> A match consists of twenty tossups and any bonuses earned by correctly answering tossups. The next unread bonus in the packet is read after each correctly answered tossup; the bonus numbers do not correspond to the tossup numbers.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> If a game is tied following the completion of the regular packet, the teams will play sudden-death tossups until a score change—a correct answer earning 10 points, or a -5 earned in the normal way—occurs to win or lose the game. Since incorrect answers on completed or already-negged tossups do not change the score, they do not, in and of themselves, lose the game.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> There are no timeouts in collegiate games. A short break, of no more than one minute, will be taken before tossup eleven. Before tossup eleven in all games, and before tossup nineteen in close games, the scorekeeper is encouraged to announce the score and to reconcile any discrepancies with players or spectators keeping an unofficial score.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>6.</strong> In collegiate tournaments, the game should not stop at periods other than halftime, except to accommodate emergencies or for other reasonable purposes that do not involve a team's attempt to gain a competitive advantage, at the moderator's discretion.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.</strong> As mentioned in rule A.5, high school tournaments should allow team members in the game to consult with coaches over whether to file a protest. This consultation must take place between the end of one tossup/bonus cycle and the start of the next tossup, and be limited to a reasonable amount of time. Under the same conditions, high school coaches may take one "timeout" per game of up to ninety seconds to advise their team members. However, these periods are not substitution opportunities; substitutions are allowed only at the times outlined in rule D.8. Attempts by a team to take a second such "timeout" in a game will simply be ignored, not penalized.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.</strong> Players on the team’s roster who are not in the game may be substituted in for another player before tossup 11, or before the first tiebreaker tossup is read if a game is tied after twenty tossup/bonus cycles, as described in rule D.4. There are no other substitution opportunities. A player who is substituted out of the game at halftime may re-enter as a substitute before a tiebreaker.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.1.</strong> A team or player who arrives while a game is already in progress may begin playing as soon as the next tossup starts, assuming the team does not already have four players active. This is not considered a “substitution.” If a team does start a game with four players, then a late-arriving player must wait for a designated substitution opportunity before he may replace another player. Unless otherwise stated by a tournament director, ACF’s policy on one team being late for a game, past the announced time at which a round is to start, is to begin reading to the team who is present and allow the opponent to start playing when they arrive, rather than to forfeit the game outright.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>E. Tossup Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> Players must buzz in before answering a tossup. Players are encouraged to answer as soon as the buzzer has locked out other players from ringing in. Thus, as soon as the buzzer systems sounds off and the moderator visually locates the participant who signals in first, that player should feel free to answer the tossup. There is no penalty for answering without being “recognized.”</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> A tossup remains alive for five seconds after it has been completed. Players who buzz as the moderator is calling time will be allowed to answer. If one team buzzes in incorrectly after the tossup has been completed, the five-second countdown begins again for the other team.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> Upon buzzing, the competitor has five seconds to begin giving his/her answer. After five seconds, the moderator will call time. Any answer which is not begun before the moderator calls time will not be considered. There will not be a prompt for an answer given if the player remains silent on a tossup. Failing to answer before time is called will be treated as a wrong answer. To avoid giving the other team extra clues as to what the answer is, the moderator should not explain close timing calls until after the tossup has been completed for both teams.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> After a player correctly answers a tossup, his team receives a bonus. The rules for bonus execution are in section F.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> Substantive conferring between team members is not allowed during the reading of a tossup question that the team is still eligible to answer. Substantive conferring refers to verbal, written or analogous communication among team members that can convey information pertinent to what the possible answer to the question is. Any instance of illegal conferring will be treated as a wrong answer; it will disqualify the conferring team from that tossup, and it will earn a neg-five if the other team has not already buzzed incorrectly and the question was not complete. Conferring calls are at the moderator’s discretion. Even if the team says an answer during or after an instance of illegal conferring, the other team will be permitted to hear the remainder of the tossup and buzz in and answer as normal, taking the other team’s utterance into account. However, if the moderator inadvertently reveals whether the answer given by the conferring team was correct, the conferring team may request that the tossup be thrown out and replaced with a substitute question read as normal to the opposing team, who will have the only opportunity to buzz in and answer.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>6.</strong> Nonsubstantive conferring, such as waving one’s hands or buzzer, issuing interjections of surprise, etc., will not be penalized, nor, generally, will it be acknowledged by the moderator at all.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.</strong> Players are responsible for monitoring their own buzzers throughout the match. Only the tossup that was just completed is subject to replay upon discovery of a buzzer system failure. Players may request buzzer checks at any time that a question is not in progress, in order to make sure the buzzer system is working.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.</strong> If a player believes his/her buzzer is not working during a tossup, a player may use physical or verbal cues directed at the game officials, such as shouting “buzz,” in order to buzz in on the tossup.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>9.</strong> Any person in the game room has the right to indicate during a tossup that the buzzer system was not cleared after the last buzz, preferably by stating the word “clear” to the moderator, and this shall never be construed as conferring or inappropriate behavior.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>10.</strong> If the moderator inadvertently reveals a tossup answer before either team has answered or after one team has given an incorrect answer, the question is thrown out. At the end of the game, if the missing points on the tossup plus the potential bonus potentially affect the outcome, appropriate replacement questions will be read, either to both teams if neither team had yet buzzed, or to one team if the other team had already answered incorrectly.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>11.</strong> If the substantive portion of a tossup has not yet begun—for example, if the moderator has only said “Next tossup,” or “Next tossup. It was…” and not read anything that could possibly indicate what the answer is—and a player buzzes in and claims to have accidentally pressed the button, the moderator will clear the system and proceed as if the buzz had not occurred. Any buzz after a substantive word has been read will be treated normally. Whether a substantive word has been read is a judgment call that is not protestable.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>12.</strong> Claims that the system is malfunctioning and buzzing in without being activated by a player will be evaluated by the moderator; if such a situation is deemed to exist, the just-read tossup will be thrown out and replaced, but no previous questions are subject to replay or protest.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>13.</strong> Answering when another player, whether on the same team or the opposing team, has buzzed in will be treated exactly like illegal conferring. This means that the nonbuzzing player who gives the answer earns a -5 for his team when applicable, and his team is locked out of answering that tossup. As in rule E.5, the moderator will call conferring only, without indicating whether the blurted answer is correct, and the other team’s members may consider the blurted answer if they buzz in later.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>F. Bonus Execution</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> Teams have five seconds after each bonus part is read to give an answer, unless otherwise indicated by the question text. If no team member directs an answer towards the moderator within five seconds, or there are multiple conflicting answers being given, then the moderator will prompt the team captain for an official answer, which must be given immediately. If no answer is given at this time, the team receives no points on that bonus part.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> The moderator will rule on the correctness of an answer, and tell what the correct answer was if the answer given was wrong, after each individual bonus part rather than at the end of the entire bonus. There is no opportunity for the team which did not answer the tossup correctly to answer or receive points on the bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> If the moderator inadvertently reveals the answer to a bonus part or parts, then all compromised bonus parts will be thrown out. If the points thus removed could affect the outcome of the game, then a replacement bonus will be read, as described in rule F.4.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> For all situations in which a bonus is replaced, this procedure will apply: The team will play the entirety of the new bonus. The team will be able to earn a total number of bonus points up to the potential maximum if the error had not occurred, but not less than what they scored on the original bonus with the error included. For example, on a three-part, “for 10 points each” bonus, if a team misses part 1, gets part 2, and then is not able to answer part 3 due to moderator error, then that team can score no fewer than 10 points on their replacement bonus and no more than 20. Even if they actually get 0 parts right on the replacement, they receive 10 because they already got one part of the original bonus and should not be penalized out of those points on the replacement bonus. Even if they actually get all parts right on the replacement, they receive 20 , because they already missed one properly read part of the original bonus and should not get a second chance at those points on the replacement bonus.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> At the end of the bonus, the moderator should clearly state the total number of points earned by the team and immediately reconcile any discrepancies over the point total.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>G. Acceptable Answers</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> The first answer given by a player on a tossup is the only answer that will be considered by the moderator. In this case, "giving an answer" involves completing at least one word of a potential answer. "Mozart—no Beethoven's piano sonatas" is not acceptable for "Beethoven's piano sonatas," but "Mo—Beethoven's piano sonatas" is (as long as the first word of the actual answer was begun before time expired). However, if the moderator judges that an otherwise allowable correction is done in response to a spectator or teammate's reaction to the initial answer, then the answer will be ruled wrong as conferring. If the player “corrects” a missed pronunciation or gives a second answer, the moderator will ignore the second answer and rule only that the first answer given was correct or incorrect. To avoid giving the other team extra clues as to what the answer is, the moderator should not explain that he ignored the second answer until after the tossup has been completed for both teams. On bonuses, this rule will directly apply only when a captain is answering a bonus after a five-second prompt; moderators may ask the captain to clarify what the team’s answer is in other situations.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> Two or more pieces of related information of different types, such as author/book, president/organization, or actor/role, but not two authors, three books, etc., may be given and treated as one answer. If any part contains the answer being sought, and the items are correctly related, the answer shall be ruled correct. If the parts are not related, or neither is the answer being sought, the answer shall be ruled incorrect. For examples, “Robert Jordan, For Whom the Bell Tolls” is correct if the answer being sought is Robert Jordan or For Whom the Bell Tolls but not if the answer is “Ernest Hemingway.” “Frederic Henry, For Whom the Bell Tolls” is never acceptable regardless of what the answer being sought is, since Frederic Henry is not in For Whom the Bell Tolls.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> When the title of a work not originally written in English is the answer, titles in the original language are generally provided in the packet. Those titles in the original language are acceptable, as are idiomatic or literal English translations and any titles under which a translation of the work has been published in English. Translations into languages that are neither the original language nor English are generally not acceptable. Thus, for Marcel Proust’s series “À la recherche du temps perdu,” that original French title is acceptable, the literal translation “In Search of Lost Time” is acceptable, and the title “Remembrance of Things Past” is acceptable because the series was published under that name in English; however, "En búsqueda del tiempo perdido" is not acceptable, since Spanish is not the original language of the series. Ambiguities across languages will normally be resolved in favor of the player; for example, “A Dog’s Heart,” “Heart of a Dog,” “The Heart of a Dog,” and “The Heart of the Dog” are all acceptable for Mikhail Bulgakov’s Sobace serdtse, as the player is not expected to figure out whether or how to supply articles that do not exist in Russian. However, players will not receive credit for a correct answer when making implausible translations: “The Heart Inside the Dog” is never acceptable, since there is no correct way to translate the Russian title in that way. Since moderators and tournament directors cannot be expected to be familiar with the intricacies of every foreign language, players are encouraged to give non-esoteric or traditional English translations, or the original-language title, in order to avoid complicated protests over translated answers.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> For names from cultures in which the family name precedes the given name, such as Chinese or Japanese names, the family name is necessary to receive credit for a correct response. The player can give either the native order of naming, with family name first, or the Anglicized order, with family name last, as an acceptable answer. An answer of the given name only will not be accepted or prompted, unless the person is widely known by a pseudonym consisting of his given name, which is acceptable under rule G.16.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.1.</strong> Compound last names must be given in their entirety, and a partial last name will not be prompted. E.g., " García Márquez" and "van Buren" are the required parts of the answer for Gabriel García Márquez and Martin van Buren, and answers such as "Marquez" or "Buren" are outright incorrect. It is acceptable to give a partial last name for people with formally compound last names when those people are usually referred to by a part of their name—e.g., "Pablo Picasso" is acceptable for "Pablo Ruiz y Picasso."</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> In most contexts, the initial two digits of dates in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries may be omitted: “63” is acceptable for an answer of 1963, but not for 1763. Similarly, it is not usually necessary to identify dates as AD/CE versus BC/BCE. Exceptions to this rule will arise on a common-sense basis from the context of the question and will be reflected in the underlining and other moderator instructions in the packet. For example, in a question which first mentions that a painter finished a particular work in 1829 and then asks when he completed another work, it is understood by common sense that an answer of "38" can only refer to "1838," so that answer will be accepted if "1838" is correct.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>6.</strong> Leading articles in titles may be omitted in most cases; e.g., “Scarlet Letter” is acceptable for The Scarlet Letter. Incorrect leading articles, including any leading articles supplied when the title actually has no leading article, will result in the answer being ruled wrong; e.g.. “A Scarlet Letter” and “The Great Expectations” are unacceptable. Full titles with leading articles are required when omitting the article may cause confusion with another work that might reasonably be expected to be an answer; e.g, “Invisible Man” is never acceptable for H.G. Wells’s The Invisible Man since Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison is a plausible answer. This rule may not always apply to translated titles; see rule G.3 for details. The definite article “the” may be added before musical works, religious texts, and other types of titles often referred to in such a manner, without rendering the answer wrong.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.</strong> Very commonly used short forms of lengthy titles may be given instead of the complete title, e.g. The Wealth of Nations is acceptable for An Inquiry Into The Nature And Causes Of The Wealth Of Nations. Subtitles are never required; e.g., Pericles is always acceptable for Pericles, Prince of Tyre. In other cases, partial titles will not be accepted or prompted.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.</strong> Commonly used abbreviations such as “J.F.K.” may be given as answers. When the abbreviation is used as a tossup clue, it will be acceptable as an answer until it is read as part of the text of the question. Similarly, chemical formulae, the postal abbreviations for states, and so forth will be accepted unless they have already been mentioned in the question at the point of answering. In some cases, the question text may specifically call for the expanded answer.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>9.</strong> The moderator may ask for any answer to be repeated if he/she did not hear it clearly. Additionally, the moderator will prompt for a more specific answer when instructed by the packet. On a tossup, the answer must be immediate; on a bonus, the team may take two seconds to confer again. If the player or team responds with a more specific answer that is still not as specific as required, the moderator may prompt again and continue to do so as long as the team continues to move toward the answer required.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>10.</strong> Embellishment of answers will be disregarded unless it renders the answer incorrect. Hesitation markers around answers ("uh…uh…G. Stanley Hall?"), the couching of answers in sentences or commentary of any kind ("Could this possibly be The Abduction from the Seraglio, which I think is awesome?") or the player forgetting what game he is playing ("Who is Vita Sackille-West?") will never render an answer incorrect. However, the player must give the first word of the actual content of the answer before the time limit expires, and cannot use filler words to try to gain extra time.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>11.</strong> If a moderator asks for spelling to distinguish between multiple answers, only letters which are essential to making the distinction need be correct. E.g, a player who spells out “M-O-N-A-Y” for Claude Monet will be ruled correct, since the moderator only wishes to distinguish between Claude Monet and Edouard Manet, rather than test the player’s spelling skill. In all cases, diacritical marks may be ignored.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>12.</strong> Players are not expected to know the exact pronunciation of every answer. Therefore, any reasonable attempt at pronouncing an answer will either be ruled correct or result in a prompt for spelling (to be evaluated under rule G.11), and any answer with the correct consonant sounds in the correct order will be accepted. For example, “Stend-HALE” or “STOON-dahl” are correct for Stendhal; “STED-nahl” or “STINK-dahl” are not. Within reasonable accommodations for those with speech impediments or heavy accents, which preferably are disclosed before the start of the game, moderators have complete discretion to judge or further prompt the pronunciation of a response, and such rulings are not protestable</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>13.</strong> Acceptable answers for fictional characters include the personal or first name, family name, nickname appearing in the work, or whole name, as long as such information is sufficient to uniquely identify the character within the fictional universe and the space of reasonable answers. Questions may sometimes ask for specific forms of character names.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>14.</strong> For American appellate court cases, either party name is acceptable unless one party is “the United States” or a particular state, in which case the other party name must be given. E.g., either “Gibbons” or “Ogden” is sufficient for Gibbons v. Ogden, but “Miranda” is required for Miranda v. Arizona, and an answer of “Arizona” will not be accepted or prompted. When giving the full name of the case, any order of party names is acceptable; e.g., Gibbons v. Ogden is interchangeable with Ogden v. Gibbons. Cases in which both the party names are names of states or “the United States” will require both party names, in either order, as the answer. Widely known informal nicknames, such as “The Sick Chicken Case,” are acceptable unless otherwise indicated in the question. Players are discouraged from using less common nicknames. Docket numbers or other methods of referring to court cases are generally not acceptable. The method of identifying a non-American court case will be given in the question and/or will normally reflect the common informal ways of referring to cases in the relevant jurisdiction.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>15.</strong> On questions which require multiple answers, the answers must be given in one sequence without any unnatural pause. Answers given after such a pause will be disregarded.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>16.</strong> The maiden names of women better known by their married names and the real names of people better known by their pseudonyms are always acceptable, and vice versa.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>17.</strong> For individuals who share a last name with another person who may be reasonably expected to be an answer in the same general category, some further form of identification may be required, at the discretion of the packet editors. In such cases, usually the first initial of the person's first name will be underlined. Unlike in the situation of people with identical first and last names, the person's actual first initial or name will usually be required. For example, answering "Shelley" will always result in a prompt for either Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley or Percy Bysshe Shelley, since both are figures from the same period of English literature and are thus considered part of the same general category. Giving either "M. Shelley" or "P. Shelley" is all that is needed to earn credit for a correct response. However, saying "Shelley the male" or "Shelley the wife" is not an acceptable answer to that prompt. As in all situations, commonly used pseudonyms and nicknames are acceptable in this situation.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>18.</strong> For individuals who share both a first and last name with another person who may be reasonably expected to be an answer in the same general category, some further form of identification may be required, at the discretion of the packet editors. In such cases, this identification need only be enough to distinguish the correct answer from the plausible incorrect answer, and need not be formal or complete. For example, “Richard H. Lee” or “Richard Lee from the eighteenth century” is enough to distinguish the Continental Congress member Richard Henry Lee from the Richard Lee who founded the Lee family in Virginia; answering “Richard Lee” for either will earn a prompt. On a question looking for the 43rd U.S. President, “George Bush” will earn a prompt in order to distinguish from the 41st president. At that point, “George W. Bush,” “the second George Bush,” “George Bush the younger” or similar such answers are all acceptable, since the player needs only distinguish the correct answer from the incorrect one, and does not need to demonstrate knowledge of George Walker Bush’s full name.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>19.</strong> Analogous figures from other myth systems will not normally be accepted when the question has given a proper name from a particular myth system; equivalent Babylonian names cannot be given for a question with only Sumerian names as clues, equivalent Roman names cannot be given for a question with only Greek names as clues, etc. No prompt will be given in such situations. However, when a mix of traditions is reflected in the names used as clues, or when no proper name has been given at the point of answering, any equivalent name for a mythological figure is acceptable.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>H. Protests</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> A protest may be made by any team member who is in the game at the time of the issue in question.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> The procedure for making a protest is simply to indicate verbally to the moderator that one wishes to protest a ruling; saying the word “protest” will suffice. Protests on a tossup or bonus must be made sometime before the next tossup is read, or immediately after the game is complete if there is a protest on tossup 20, the associated bonus, or a tiebreaker tossup. Any discussion that needs to occur within the game room should happen after the end of the tossup/bonus cycle, rather than while a question is still live.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> The other team may concede the protest, in which case the protest is considered resolved in favor of the protesting team. If the other team does not concede, the moderator may consult with any other tournament staff in the room and make a ruling. If the moderator does not feel competent to rule on the issue at hand or if the protesting team is not satisfied with the moderator’s ruling, then the protest becomes at issue for tournament staff, and will be resolved under the procedure described in rules H.6 through H.11.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> The following potential errors, and only the following, are protestable:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.1.</strong> The answer in the packet is wrong for the question and the protesting player/team gave the correct answer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.2.</strong> The question or answer was ambiguous, so the answer given by the player should be accepted since it fits all the clues given in the entire question text, or all the clues up to a significantly deep point in the question.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.3.</strong> The player gave a correct alternate name for the answer that was not included in the list of acceptable answers to the question.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.4.</strong> More information was required than was reasonable to identify the answer, and the protesting player gave sufficient information to identify the answer but not as much as the packet required and was ruled incorrect.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.5.</strong> Two or more clues within the question uniquely describe different answers, or one clue definitely does not refer to the same answer as the other clues—hence, there is no correct answer to the question. This protest may be lodged by either team at the end of a question converted by neither team or by the team that did not get the question after a question is converted by one team. However, if this situation arises on a tossup that the other team converted before the first clue creating a contradiction was read, there may be no protest because the team that missed the question was not misled.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.6.</strong> The protesting team’s opponent received credit for an incorrect answer through either packet or moderator error.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> Nothing else is protestable, including but not limited to: judgment calls of any kind such as calling time, whether a tossup had begun before an accidental buzz as described in E.11, whether verbal conferring occurred, or the failure of the question to require a prompt on an opposing team’s answer.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.1.</strong> Formal protests relying solely on a player’s dispute with a moderator over what the moderator heard are also prohibited. However, if and only if the opposing team concedes the moderator's error in discerning the given answer, the moderator will re-evaluate the actually given answer.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>6.</strong> The tournament director has ultimate authority to rule on all live protests but may delegate this authority to another individual or committee for the duration of the tournament or on a case-by-case basis.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.</strong> A live protest whose upholding could change the outcome of the game will always be ruled upon. In the event that such a protest is upheld, the following procedures will be followed depending on the circumstances that produced the protest:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.1.</strong> For a team claiming that the answer they gave to a tossup was correct but ruled incorrect by the packet or moderator under appropriate sections in rule H.4: If the other team subsequently converted the tossup, their tossup points, and their bonus points earned pursuant to that tossup, will be removed. The tossup points will be given to the team whose protest was upheld and their neg removed. The protesting team will be reseated and play a bonus, if necessary.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.2.</strong> For a team claiming that the answer they gave to a bonus was correct but ruled wrong by the packet or moderator under appropriate sections in rule H.4: they will receive the points for the bonus answer.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.3.</strong> For a team seeking the replacement of a tossup under rule H.4: If the other team subsequently converted the tossup, their tossup points, and their bonus points earned pursuant to that tossup, will be removed. The teams will be reseated and a new tossup will be read. If the other team gets the tossup right, they will get the tossup points as well as the points earned on the original bonus. If the protesting team gets the tossup right, they will get the tossup points and be read a new bonus.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.4.</strong> For a team seeking replacement of a bonus part under rule H.4: The protesting team will be reseated and a new bonus will be read as described in rule F.4.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.5.</strong> For a team protesting an improperly accepted tossup answer under rule H.4.6: The opponent’s tossup points and any points on the associated bonus will be removed. If the protesting team had already answered the tossup incorrectly and has no other protest, then this ends the resolution of the protest. If they had not yet buzzed in, the protesting team will be reseated and read a replacement tossup, for their team only, which they may buzz on and answer normally. If they convert the tossup, a bonus will be read.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>7.6.</strong> For a team protesting an improperly accepted bonus answer under rule H.4.6: The opponent’s points will be removed.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>8.</strong> If the resolution of any protest as above creates a tie, then the teams will play a tiebreaker under the normal procedure as described in rule D.4. The tiebreaker will only be played if and after the protest creating the tie is upheld, and should not be played beforehand on any contingency basis.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>9.</strong> Before making a final ruling on a protest, the tournament director or his/her designated officer or committee will make every reasonable effort to consult reliable academic resources in order to help determine the factual accuracy of the complaint. Teams involved in the protest may offer suggestions as to where to find relevant information if this is done in a polite and quick manner.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>10.</strong> If the tournament director determines that a team is lodging frivolous or abusive protests, he will warn the team for inappropriate conduct under rule B.3 and may take further action if the behavior continues.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>11.</strong> The general principle at work in ruling on protests and in enforcing all rules, and especially to be kept in mind in deciding how to proceed in areas where the rules are unclear, is to reward knowledge and to uphold common practice of past independent quizbowl tournaments. Moderators and tournament directors should not go out of their way to find a reason to rule an answer wrong, and the relationship among teams and between teams and the staff should be cordial and in the spirit of academic pursuit.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>12.</strong> The improper application of rules by the moderator, to the degree that it affects the competitive play of the game, is outside the realm of "protests." Only in this situation do teams have the right to leave the game room and ask the tournament director to intervene immediately, rather than waiting until the game is finished. Tournament directors should handle such a situation with the goal of restoring the game to the point where it would be had the rules been applied properly; in extreme cases, this may mean throwing out and replacing all affected questions, or restarting the entire game. Tournament directors are encouraged to be sure their moderators are familiar with the rules in order to avoid such situations.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>I. Tournament formats and tiebreakers for standings</strong></span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.</strong> When two or more teams have the same record and are competing for fewer spots available in the next phase of the tournament than there are teams involved in the tie, the tournament director should break ties based on play-in games on full or half packets when time constraints and available packets permit, using rules I.1.1 and I.1.2 to determine how to seed the play-in games. When this is not feasible, the tournament director should use either PPG or bonus conversion to break the tie directly, as determined by rules I.1.1 and I.1.2. The head-to-head results of previous matches should not be used to break ties at any time.</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.1.</strong> If the teams have played the same set of opponents throughout the day, as in a round-robin format, points per game should be used to break ties or to seed for play-in games.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1.2.</strong> If the teams have not played the same set of opponents throughout the day, such as when comparing teams from different preliminary pools in a high school tournament for “wild-card” spots in a single-elimination playoff, bonus conversion should be used to break ties or to seed for play-in games, in order to isolate the teams’ performances from the different sets of opponents played.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2.</strong> High school tournaments should use whatever format is appropriate for the field size, staff availability, and local traditions. It is suggested that all teams be offered the opportunity to play at least seven meaningful games, with “meaningful games” being defined as games that may impact a team’s final placement in the tournament. Formats which produce a top-to-bottom ranking of all teams are encouraged.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.</strong> For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals, the editors may choose to issue mandatory formats for each potential field size, and exceptions should be negotiated directly with the editors. In the absence of such guidelines, and for all other collegiate tournaments, the only absolute requirements for collegiate formats are as follows:</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.1.</strong> The tiebreaker procedures described in rule I.1 should be followed, and the finals format described in rule I.5 should be used.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.2.</strong> Single-elimination playoffs, double-elimination playoffs, and playoff formats fundamentally identical to either should not be used.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3.3.</strong> When using a full round-robin format followed by a split into playoff brackets for rematches, preliminary records should carry over for the calculation of the final standings. When using a multi-bracket preliminary format followed by rebracketing into new divisions for round-robin playoffs, preliminary records should not carry over. When using a multi-bracket preliminary format followed by rebracketing into new divisions for crossover playoffs, only the results of games against other teams in the same playoff division should carry over.</span></p>
<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>4.</strong> In the absence of mandated formats from editors, tournament directors should endeavor to offer teams as many meaningful games as possible given packet, staff, and time constraints. A minimum number of ten meaningful games is usually considered acceptable. Formats which produce a top-to-bottom ranking of all teams are encouraged.</span>

<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5.</strong> The ACF-format finals procedure for collegiate tournaments requires that a team which has cleared the field or playoff bracket by two or more games in the standings wins the tournament outright. When two teams are tied, they play a one-game final. When a team is exactly one game ahead of the second-place team, a weighted best-of-three final occurs, with the team that has the better record needing to win only one game to take the championship, but the trailing team needing to win two games in a row. If there are ties for the second-place spot in such a situation, or ties of three or more teams for first place, the tournament director should consult rule I.1 to set up the appropriate tiebreakers and eliminate all but two teams, then play those two teams in the appropriate finals format.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a name="who"></a>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
Any team with <em>at least</em> one person (two people for ACF Fall) on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) the the academic year <em>two years prior to the current year</em>, that school must submit a packet (e.g. any team with a player [two players for ACF Fall] who played prior to September 1 2015 must submit a packet to compete in ACF tournaments in the 2016-2017 academic year.)

FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?
<p style="padding-left:30px;">All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments. Novice collegiate events with strict eligiblity requirements do <i>not</i> count as regular collegiate academic tournaments in determining packet requirement.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.</p>
This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please c<a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/contacts/">ontact the ACF editor for the tournament</a>.
<h2><a name="sample"></a>Sample Packet</h2>
Want to know what a well-formatted packet looks like? Take a look at this packet our editor Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.

[googleapps domain="docs" dir="document/d/1VcuDQbNYG124iqvBu6AdXbcUq-3sOc_YP_dyjXvXTFE/pub" query="embedded=true" width="800" height="400" /]
<h2><a name="distribution"></a>Distribution</h2>
All Full Packet submissions should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the distribution outlined below.

The following distribution applies to ACF Regionals and ACF Nationals Submissions. See the <a href="#">ACF Fall Announcement</a> for information about half-packet distributions.

<em>Note: The X/Y notation used throughout this section refers to X tossups and Y bonuses. Eg. If you see Fine Arts 3/3, it means 3 tossups and 3 bonuses. </em>
<h3>Literature 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>British literature: 1/1</li>
	<li>European literature from 500 CE onwards: 1/1</li>
	<li>World (anything not covered above): 1/0 or 0/1</li>
	<li>Anything you want, including ancient European literature, more of any category above, or combinations of categories above: 1/2 or 2/1</li>
</ul>
<em> Vary questions across time periods. Do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please make sure your questions span a variety of answers such as authors, novels, poems, criticism, essays, etc.</em><strong>
</strong>
<h3>History 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>American history: 1/1</li>
	<li>European, Canadian, and Australian history: 3/3 (1 should be on classical history, 1 on British history, and 3 on continental Europe from three different post-classical time periods.)</li>
	<li>World history: 1/1 (from two different areas of the world besides those covered above)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 4 questions on military history (battles, wars, or people known primarily for their military accomplishments.)</em>
<h3>Science 5/5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Biology 1/1</li>
	<li>Chemistry 1/1</li>

	<li>Math or computer science: 1 question</li>
	<li>Astronomy, earth science/geology, or other science not covered above: 1 question</li>
	<li>Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don’t write a second question on any of the “minor” fields. Questions which straddle the line between disciplines should be used for Any Science. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</li>
</ul>
<em>You may write up to 1 question on the history of science. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered science rather than science history. </em>
<h3>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</li>
	<li>Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</li>
	<li>Philosophy: 1/1 (different parts of philosophical history)</li>
</ul>
<em>Write least 1 and no more than 2 questions in this category on non-Western topics.</em> <em>You may write about events which straddle the line between history and religion for either history or religion, but don’t write about religious history for both categories. </em>
<h3>Fine Arts 3/3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Painting: 1/1</li>
	<li>Classical music (excluding opera): 1/1</li>
	<li>Other Fine Arts: 1/1 (opera, sculpture, architecture, dance, jazz, photography, art film; do NOT write more painting or classical music)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geography 1/1</h3>
Possible topics for this category include physical features, countries, cities, regions, etc. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.

<em>Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Do not write both questions on the same area of the world. </em>
<h3>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</h3>
You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above. You can write questions which mix categories here.

<em>Do not write more than one trash question</em> <em>from the same general category. E.g. Don’t write two questions on sports.</em>
<h2><a name="philosophy"></a>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.
<h3>Tossups</h3>
A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.</p>
Do NOT write tossups which are:
<ul>
	<li>Geared towards specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
	<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
	<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:
<ul>
	<li>An easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
	<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
	<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.

You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.

We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, <a href="#dp">click here</a>.
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
Please follow the ACF Formatting Guidelines when formatting your packet.

Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</li>
	<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or an “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Past ACF Events as models</h3>
In addition to the above question-writing guides, we encourage you to consult old ACF events as writing models.

We recommend:
<ul>
	<li>For ACF Fall-level difficulty - <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/334/">ACF Fall 2008</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/82/">ACF Fall 2009</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/457/">ACF Fall 2012</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Regionals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/310/">ACF Regionals 2008</a> and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/248/">ACF Regionals 2010</a>;</li>
	<li>For ACF Nationals-level difficulty – <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/298/">ACF Nationals 2009</a>, <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/247/">ACF Nationals 2010</a>, and <a href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/650/">ACF Nationals 2014</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="how"></a>How to submit your packet</h2>
<h3>Document format</h3>
Please submit your packet as a .doc, .docx, or .rtf file. Submit all questions in 10-point Times New Roman font. Your document should have 1-inch margins on all sides. PDFs, .odt, .html, .txt or any other formats are <strong>not acceptable</strong>.

<em>If editors cannot open your packet on the first try, they will return your packet to you and have you re-send a fixed version before it is considered submitted for fee purposes.</em>
<h3>Document Name</h3>
Please follow the following file-naming scheme when submitting packets:
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;">&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt; - &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt;</p>
For instance, if UC Irvine’s A team is submitting a packet for 2015 ACF Regionals, it should be named:
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ACF Regionals 2015 – UC Irvine A</p>

<h2><a name="dp"></a>Discounts/Penalties</h2>
We offer discounts for early submission of packets, and levy a penalty for late packet submissions. Click here for the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-discountpenalty-schedule/">packet-submission discount/penalty schedules</a>.

<strong>Gross deviation from packet-formatting guidelines</strong>: $50 penalty

<strong>Submission of prohibited types of questions</strong>: $25 penalty per question

Prohibited types of questions include:
<ul>
	<li>Spelling questions, i.e. questions for which the answer involves spelling a word.</li>
	<li>Binary matching questions, i.e. questions of the form “Given X, name Y” which do not have prose clues.</li>
	<li>5-10-15 bonuses, i.e. bonuses whose hard-parts are worth 15 points. These questions should instead be changed to 10-10-10 bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="plagiarism"></a>Plagiarism</h2>
We do not tolerate plagiarism, and there will be consequences for any instances of plagiarism. Please refer to ACF’s policy on plagiarism.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Official Player and Team Eligibility Rules</b><b>
</b><b>Last revised August 27, 2016 </b>

<strong>Effective for 2016-17 competition year forward</strong>

<i>(The following is a comprehensive set of rules for establishing eligibility at collegiate tournaments. It is formally binding on all sites of official ACF tournaments held within any given competition year, and may be enforced or modified at the tournament director's' discretion at other collegiate tournaments. The Official ACF Gameplay Rules are now a separate document from this one.)</i>

<b>1) </b>In keeping with the typical schedules defined and set by collegiate institutions, the <b>competition year</b> [or <b>academic year</b>] begins on August 1 of a given calendar year and continues through July 31 of the immediately successive calendar year. (<i>For ACF purposes, a single competition year begins on August 1, then contains, in order, ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, and ACF Nationals, between then and the immediately successive July 31.</i>)
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A.</strong> The presence of leap days has no bearing on what constitutes a "year" or a "competition year" according to these rules; for example, July 31, 2015 to July 31, 2020 is considered five years and zero days.</p>
<b>2) </b>For purposes of these rules, a <b>class</b> is a college-level class or course taken, for credit, at the institution at which the player is attempting to establish eligibility. <b>Taking</b> or having<b> taken</b> a class means that, on the date of the tournament, the player is currently enrolled in that class, or has completed that class for credit earlier in the academic competition year.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b>A. </b>A class is considered to be a part of whichever competition year in which it begins or its first meeting, assignment, etc. is conducted. (<i>For example: A class which begins on March 1, 2016 and ends on August 2, 2016 is considered a part of the 2015-16 competition year, and is therefore not a basis for eligibility in the 2016-17 competition year.</i>) The only exception to the above is if a class is held within a designate "fall term" (<i>or equivalent</i>) which begins prior to August 1 and continues at least through the date of ACF Fall in a given, in which case the class will be treated as though its start date were August 1. (<i>E.g.: A class which begins on July 15, 2016 and ends on December 10, 2016 is considered a part of the 2016-17 competition year.</i>)</p>
<b>3)</b> Any accredited real-world educational institution or school that offers recognized postsecondary degrees of the associate's, bachelor's, master's, or doctorate types (<i>including, e.g., M.Div and JD</i>) may participate in any collegiate-level ACF tournament. This includes all sorts of post-secondary institutions, such as service academies and community colleges. Institutions with the word “online” in their names, or which only provide online certificates (e.. Coursera), or which only provide certificates of completion (e.g. tech "bootcamp"s), are not eligible.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A. </strong>Elementary, middle, and high schools are not eligible to enter teams in official ACF events. Individual players who are simultaneously enrolled in a high school and in a collegiate degree program of the types listed above may be able to establish eligibility for a collegiate institution under Rule C above.</p>
<b>4) </b>Players may establish eligibility in one of three ways, labelled Rule A, Rule B, and Rule C below.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A. </strong>(<i>Rule A - Undergraduate Eligibility.</i>) Any person who meets ACF’s definition of an “undergraduate” (<i>See Eligibility Rule 11 below</i>) on the date of the competition year’s ACF Fall tournament, and who has not been granted a BA or equivalent degree prior to the academic year for which eligibility is being sought, may establish eligibility at a postsecondary institution by doing either of the following during or before the first tournament for which eligibility is sought:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>i)</b> taking any class for which credit at the institution is offered, explicitly including but not limited to traditional classroom instruction, distance learning, or dual-enrollment classes offered at and/or through high schools, or</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>ii)</b> doing any equivalent academic work for which credit or specific satisfaction of a degree requirement is actually earned, including but not limited to supervised independent study, work placement, or internship.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b> B. </b>(<i>Rule B - Postgraduate Eligibility.</i>) A person who does not meet ACF’s definition of “undergraduate” (<i>See</i> <i>Eligibility rule 11 below</i>) on or before the date of the year’s ACF Fall tournament, or who has been granted a BA or equivalent degree prior to the current academic year for which eligibility is being sought, or both, cannot claim eligibility under Rule A. Such a student is eligible to play for a postsecondary institution if he or she is in a specific degree program for a degree granted by that institution.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>i)</b> A “degree program” is defined for this purpose as the required course of study offered by a postsecondary institution for a specific bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral, or equivalent degree (<i>including JD, M.Div., etc.</i>). A second bachelor’s degree is acceptable as a “degree program” for this purpose. Professional certification programs, community college associate’s degrees, and other similar degrees do not qualify under this rule, and such students must meet the Rule C standard instead.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>ii)</b> A student who is in good standing and making academic progress at any above-defined program during the academic year for which eligibility is being sought will be eligible without regard to any further considerations. The class or other component of the program being cited as “academic progress” must be undertaken during or before the first tournament for which eligibility is being sought.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>iii)</b> Graduate students whose only remaining work is the completion of a thesis, and who are working towards completion of that thesis, are explicitly eligible under Rule B.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>iv)</b> “ABD” students who are still permitted to submit a thesis in the future, but are not making academic progress at the time, are not eligible unless they meet one of the other routes to eligibility, or unless and until they resume active status towards completion of their thesis (<i>as determined by the university</i>).</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>C.</strong> (<i>Rule C - Other.</i>) A person who does not meet the requirements for eligibility under Rule A or Rule B must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>i)</b> The student must be taking a total of at least three full-credit courses during the year, all through the institution for which eligibility is being sought, and all during or before the first ACF tournament being played under the eligibility thus earned.<i> (For example, a student wishing to play ACF Fall must be taking three or more classes in the fall, but a student wishing to play ACF Regionals need only take a total of three classes between the fall and spring.)</i> A “full-credit course” is a course offered for the ordinary amount of credit that a “normal” course, expected to be taken by undergraduates with junior or senior standing at the university, earns. (<i>For example, a university at which a semester-long upperclassman-level class ordinarily earns three credits, this means a three-credit or more course. Because universities often count credits differently or offer more credits than standard for certain types of classes, this is defined with reference to each specific university rather than as a set amount of “credits” globally. A standard course for credit at a graduate school, professional school, professional certificate program, high school dual-enrollment program, or other program for credit qualifies as a “full-credit course.”</i>)</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>ii)</b> The courses may be in classroom, online, etc., but to establish eligibility under Rule C, they must be courses only. They cannot be substituted for with independent study, internships, or other non-class academic work.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b>iii)</b> The ACF Eligibility Committee may investigate students seeking eligibility under Rule C to determine whether they have a legitimate, non-quizbowl-based, academic-path reason for being enrolled in classes. If such students are found to be merely trying to gain technical eligibility, or to be “taking classes for its own sake,” they will then be ruled ineligible. Students in this situation must have a specific academic goal in mind for taking their classes to be eligible for ACF.</p>
<b>5) </b>The ACF <b>Eligibility Committee</b> for a given competition year consists of the head editors of ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, and ACF Nationals across that competition year. This committee is the final authority on any question of eligibility. Any player, coach or other team adviser, or director of an official ACF tournament may petition the Committee regarding their own eligibility or the eligibility of any other player, both prior to an ACF tournament and up to three weeks after the conclusion of the event. Players who question their own eligibility must petition the committee at least two weeks before the tournament that they wish to play. (<i>If the committee retroactively determines that a player was ineligible, sanctions are available under Rule 10.</i>) Once the committee determines a player to be eligible or ineligible, that decision will stand for the entire competition year unless the educational circumstances of the player in question change, in which case the committee may be asked to re-determine.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A.</strong> The ACF Eligibility Committee reserves the right to investigate or remove someone’s eligibility to play ACF tournaments or play for a particular school if the spirit of the rules, which is generally representable as “college quizbowl is for college students,” is not met.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b> B. </b>Any person entitled to serve on the ACF Eligibility Committee by virtue of being the head editor of ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, or ACF Nationals in a giving competition year may instead designate a proxy to serve on the ACF Eligibility Committee in his/her/their stead, either for a limited duration or for the entire competition year. No person may be designated to serve as a proxy on the ACF Eligibility Committee unless that person is a Full Member of ACF, as defined in the ACF Constitution.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>C.</strong> Each decision of the Eligibility Committee requires at least two of the three members to agree on a given determination.</p>
<b>6)</b> Holding any prior degree from any institution will not, in and of itself, render an otherwise eligible player ineligible. The taking of minimal course loads for the sole purpose of retaining eligibility at an institution that the player would not otherwise be attending is prohibited. Determining whether this is taking place is at the sole discretion of the Eligibility Committee; players who do not meet the letter of the eligibility rules laid out here but who believe that their circumstances merit consideration should petition the Eligibility Committee before attempting to register for any ACF tournaments.

<b>7)</b> Once a player completes a class or academic obligation which renders them eligible, the eligibility thereby conferred lasts until the end of the competition year in which the class was completed. Players may not participate in tournaments held earlier in a competition year than their classes or other eligibility-granting academic arrangements begin. (<i>Example 1: A player who is on academic leave for fall 2016, at a school which holds semester-long classes in fall 2016 and in spring 2017, may NOT play ACF Fall 2016. If that player resumes student status in spring 2017, that player MAY play ACF Regionals 2017 and/or ACF Nationals 2017.) (Example 2: A player who is enrolled in fall 2016 but on academic leave in spring 2017 may play any of ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, or ACF Nationals across the 2016-17 calendar year.)</i>

<b>8)</b> If a player meets the eligibility requirements for a portion of the competition year prior to being awarded a degree in the middle of that same competition year (<i>e.g. receives a Ph.D in January; graduates and receives a BA in December</i>), that player retains eligibility to play or that school for the entirety of that same competition year, even if the school has ceased to consider that player an enrolled student.

<b>9)</b> Players may play for any collegiate institution for which they are eligible at any given tournament. Players need not apply for special dispensation to play for a second school during a particular academic year if they are able to establish eligibility at the second institution. A player may represent only one institution at any given tournament.

<b>10)</b> Teams may consist of individuals from only one school or institution and may not include non-students or individuals enrolled at other schools.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b></b> <strong>A. </strong>Players at graduate institutions which are affiliated with a state’s university system in general but with no particular undergraduate college may choose to form their own team or to play for any school in the relevant university system. The ACF Eligibility Committee must approve any instance in which such a student plays for another school in the relevant university system.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><b></b> <strong>B. </strong>With the exception of the above, teams composed of players from multiple institutions or standalone campuses within the same university system are not allowed.</p>
<b>11)</b> If a player is determined to be ineligible prior to an event, the sole penalty for that player will be disqualification from playing at that event on the team for which that player is ineligible. Such a player will still be allowed to play the event in question for any other team for which they meet the eligibility requirements of these rules, and their eligibility for future events will not be affected. A team which is discovered after an event to have used one or more ineligible players may be required to retroactively forfeit games involving that player and any titles dependent on the results of those particular games, but no other penalty will apply.

<b>12)</b> For collegiate tournaments which recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of “undergraduate” status (<i>such as all official ACF tournaments</i>), an “undergraduate” is a player who did not receive a BA or equivalent or higher degree prior to the competition year in which the tournament is taking place, AND who first enrolled in a collegiate program in a competition year four or fewer years prior to the competition year in which the tournament is taking place. “Enrolled in a collegiate program” means enrollment at a postsecondary institution for the purpose of taking classes toward an associate's, bachelor's, or equivalent degree, excluding any enrollment occurring before the player has obtained a high school degree <i>(such as post-secondary high school programs</i>). For purposes of this rule, the date of enrollment is the school’s first day of classes in the first period in which the player has enrolled, excluding any summer term. If a particular institution’s fall academic calendar begins before August 1, the player’s date of enrollment will be set as August 1.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>A. </strong>For the purposes of determining who is or is not an undergraduate player, any competition years or segments thereof during which that person was unenrolled or on academic leave are counted exactly the same as competition years in which that person had standard or maximal enrollment. (<i>E.g.: A player who first enrolled in college in 2011-12, completed a standard freshman year, took four years of academic leave in a row, and then re-enrolled as an undergraduate in 2016-17 would NOT be considered an undergraduate player for the 2016-17 competition year.</i>)</p>
<b>13)</b> For collegiate tournaments that recognize high-finishing teams and/or individuals of “Division II” status (<i>such as all ACF tournaments</i>), a “Division II” player is any player who first enrolled in a collegiate program in the ongoing competition year or in the competition year immediately prior to the ongoing one (<i>i.e. is any freshman/first-year or sophomore/second-year</i>)]]></content:encoded>

<h1 id="h.g4yj4yl9zeml"><em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">About These Rules)</span></em></h1>
<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(This is the official set of gameplay rules </span><span style="font-weight:400;">of the Academic Competition Federation, put forward for use at all official ACF events and at other applicable collegiate or collegiate-style quizbowl events.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Eligibility information specifically pertaining to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">ACF events</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> now exists as the ACF Official Eligibility Rules, and is</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> no longer</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> covered </span><span style="font-weight:400;">by this document</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">Within these rules, all plain text has the effective force of a rule governing all participants within a quizbowl match or tournament. The initial use of an important rules term, at the point where that term is most clearly defined, is given in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">bold</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [with alternate rules terms for that same thing bolded within </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">square brackets</span><span style="font-weight:400;">]. In places where examples or clarifying "reminder text" might be useful, but not strictly necessary, to understanding the rules, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">that reminder text has been presented within parentheses in italics, as it is here.</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">These rules were ratified as a full replacement of the hitherto-existing rule set on August 27, 2016. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Some portions of these rules were, with permission, based on the</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> official gameplay rules of the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence (PACE), and on the</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> previous copyrighted rule sets of PACE and ACF. </span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">Any tournament may use these rules free of charge</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> without prior permission from </span><span style="font-weight:400;">ACF</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">However, t</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ournament directors are expected to announce in advance any adjustments, choices, or modifications they might make to</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> alter</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> these rules at their own events, and to apply any such modifications consistently across all matches in a given tournament</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, without attributing authorship of any such modifications to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">ACF</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.)</span></em>
<h1 id="h.3ql6qbk7cphr"><span style="font-weight:400;">A. Definitions and Participants</span></h1>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">tournament</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a set of organized quizbowl matches. The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">tournament director</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is the designated on-site organizer of a particular tournament.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each quizbowl match is played in a game room by two teams.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each game room shall have a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">moderator</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, who reads the questions to the two teams playing matches in that game room, and a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">scorekeeper</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, who records the official score on an official scoresheet as a match progresses. It is permissible for a single person to fulfill both the role of moderator and the role of scorekeeper for a game room.   </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">At</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the tournament director's discretion, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">additional officials with other roles</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> <em>(</em></span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. a person keeping unofficial score on a blackboard or whiteboard for the benefit of spectators</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"><em>)</em> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">may be appointed to help manage a game room or to help manage the tournament as a whole.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> team</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> consists of a roster of no fewer than one and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">no more than six </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">players</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, inclusive.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">(At its own discretion, each team may declare a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">captain</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> prior to the start of any match. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">These rules never require a captain</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to serve in any unique or official role, and the declaration of a captain does not change which given answers the moderator must rule on as a bonus is being played.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> See Section E, "Bonuses".</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></em></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">An individual player may never be on the roster of more than one team at a single tournament. If multiple teams at a tournament represent the same school or institution, there can be no overlap in membership between any of those teams.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">An </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">active player</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a player who is able to give answers to questions within a match. Any/all players who are not active within an ongoing match are </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">non-active</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">substituted out</span><span style="font-weight:400;">; or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">subbed out</span><span style="font-weight:400;">]. In all respects other than the prospect of being substituted in (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See C.12</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), a non-active player shall be treated the same as any other spectator.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each team may be accompanied by up to one</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">coach</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">during the match. Coaches may lodge protests at appropriate times </span><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"Protests"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, may call for timeouts and/or substitutions at appropriate times, and may approach their players to speak to them at designated pauses in gameplay (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section C</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"Match Execution"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). In all other respects, a coach shall be treated the same as any other spectator (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See I.2</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). Together, the set of all players and coaches from both teams in a match constitute the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">participant</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s in that match.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">No team may have more than one person serve officially as coach during any single match. If more than one person could conceivably serve as a team's official coach for the duration of the match (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">for example, if one school brings multiple faculty members at the tournament and two or more of those faculty members are in the game room with a team from that school</span><span style="font-weight:400;">), the moderator shall ask the players on that team to designate their official coach before the match begins.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">T</span><span style="font-weight:400;">he term </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">question</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> refers to either a tossup in its entirety or a bonus in its entirety (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">i.e. a three-part bonus counts as a whole as one "question"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">clue</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ny standalone sentence within a question, or any clause or string of phrases which could be excerpted and read as though it were a standalone sentence referring to the desired answer; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">each question contain</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> multiple clues referring to the desired answer(</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">s</span><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>As such, it is never the case that a clue has been given if no main verb has yet been read</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">An </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">answer</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a verbal response given by a player, which can be ruled on to determine whether or not that player's team is to be awarded points and how the match is to proceed. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">packet</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is the collection of questions </span><span style="font-weight:400;">from which</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a moderator read</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in a particular match.</span></li>

<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each match shall be played using a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">buzzer system</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">lockout system</span><span style="font-weight:400;">], an electronic device wh</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ich allows any individual user to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">activate</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a signal (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">such as a light accompanied by a sound</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) and which locks out all other users from signaling once any one individual user has signaled</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A single </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">button</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or buzzer </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">unit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> or buzzer </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">module</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] is the device which any individual player uses to give a signal, as a component connected to the overall lockout system. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>The button is the entire hand-held device, irrespective of its shape -- in a buzzer system where each player is handed a paddle which can be used to give a signal by clamping one's hand rather than pressing with one finger, the individual paddle is considered to be a "button"</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) Each player in a match must be able to operate exactly one button which, when used, produces a unique signal (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">typically a light and/or sound</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) distinguishable from those of the other buttons in the buzzer system.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">An individual player </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">buzz</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">es</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> in</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">buzz</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">es</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] </span><span style="font-weight:400;">by</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> using their button to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">activate</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a signal (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">such as the activation of a light accompanied by a sound</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) which locks out all other users from signaling in the same way.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The buzzer system may and must be </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">cleared</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">reset</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] by match officials at appropriate times. Clearing the buzzer system deactivates any previously-</span><span style="font-weight:400;">active</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> signals displayed by the buzzer system and removes any electronic lockout affecting individual buttons. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Before any match, each team may perform a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">buzzer check</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> by ensuring that each player's button functions normally and that the system can be cleared. If either of the above conditions is not met and a spare buzzer system exists in the vicinity, the buzzer system shall be replaced with a spare as soon as possible, unless both teams agree to use the system in its partially-functional state.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that all reasonable efforts to obtain a spare buzzer system have been exhausted and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">no spare buzzer system is available</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, both teams may agree to use a common verbal or physical sign as an equivalent to buzzing in (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. saying "Buzz"; slapping the table</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). In matches played without a buzzer system, all timing calls with regards to who buzzed in first</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> are moderator judgments and are not protestable.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that all reasonable efforts to obtain a spare buzzer system have been exhausted and a partially-working buzzer system is available, the tournament director may authorize the use of the partially-working system.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless otherwise announced, the only materials which players are allowed to use during a match, besides the buzzer system, are writing implements and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">pieces of paper</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. Any piece of paper brought into a match must be completely blank</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> except for rule lines</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> and devoid of writing or erasure marks. Prepared notes or other study aids may not be brought to the area where active players are. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">This prohibition still applies during stoppages in gameplay such as at halftime or during time-outs</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A </span><span style="font-weight:400;">bound notebook</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> may be brought into a match, provided that it is turned to a completely blank page before the match begins and that no other pages within the notebook are visible. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Players may keep score</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> on a pre-printed scoresheet, provided that any such scoresheet is otherwise devoid of additional writing, erasure marks, or modifications prior to the match.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Players may not use any personal electronic devices (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>including, but not limited to: cell phones, tablets, laptops, "wearable" tech devices</em>) </span><span style="font-weight:400;"> during the duration of a match. This prohibition extends to any and all pauses in gameplay within a match.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The above rule does not apply to accommodations required by players due to a physical disability, such as hearing aids or electronic wheelchairs.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Designated coaches may use an electronic device for the purpose of keeping score or taking notes during a match. Any electronic files used for this purpose must be reasonably blank  (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: empty digital scoresheet, blank Word document</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) before the match begins. Coaches who use an electronic device in this manner are obligated to keep all other programs and functions of the device closed or hidden as the match is in progress, and may not show any electronic scoresheet or notes to any player involved in the match except at halftime or during time-outs.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Before the start of a match, all players, coaches, and spectators must ensure that electronic devices that may make noise or otherwise disrupt a match (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>including, but not limited to: cell phones, tablets, laptops, watch alarms, "wearable" tech devices, cameras with flash</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> are set to "silent" or turned off so that they cannot disrupt the match. The moderator may demand that any such device be removed from the game room if it is not properly deactivated in this manner.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">No person within a game room may make an audio or video recording of a match without the express permission of both teams, the moderator, and the tournament director.</span></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.xanu3cj077at"><span style="font-weight:400;">C. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Match Execution</span></h1>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">cycle</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [</span><span style="font-weight:400;">or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">tossup-bonus cycle</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] </span><span style="font-weight:400;">consists of the reading of a single tossup question and any bonus question earned if a</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> player duly gives a</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> correct</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> answer to that tossup question.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>See Section D, "Tossups," and Section E, "Bonuses".</em>)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator should read the tossups designated for regulation play in the sequential order provided by the packet. In the event that the moderator skips over a tossup by accident, the moderator should go back and read the skipped-over tossup after the cycle in which the error is discovered. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>The cycles of the game can decouple from the numbering of tossups in the packet if this happens. For example, if the moderator skips the tossup numbered "2", but doesn't realize it until reading the tossup numbered "20," the moderator should then read the tossup number "2" to begin the twentieth cycle of the game</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a replacement question is needed, that replacement question is considered to be the single tossup or bonus in the cycle, rather than the question which was thrown out to necessitate the replacement.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Regulation play</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> consists of twenty cycles and any pauses taken between those cycles. A </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">match</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> consists of regulation play, followed by any pauses or tiebreaker questions required after the last cycle of regulation play. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If question supplies allow for it, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the tournament director may permit each instance of regulation play across all matches of a tournament to consist of a number of cycles greater than twenty. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">At such a tournament, halftime (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See C.7</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) takes place after the cycle whose number is half the total number, rounding up in the case of an odd number of cycles, rather than after the tenth cycle.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If question supplies are limited such that it is not possible for regulation play in all matches across a tournament to consist of twenty cycles, the tournament director may permit designated </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">mini-match</span><span style="font-weight:400;">es, in which regulation play consists of ten cycles. In a mini-match, there is no halftime, and substitutions may not be made at any point during regulation play. All points at which mini-matches will be in use must be announced by the tournament director before the tournament begins. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each team may have no more than four active players competing in a match at any one time. If a team consists of four or more players, it must select four of those people as active players before the match begins. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>The starting lineup of active players need not be the same from match to match</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">After each cycle of a match, the moderator shall clear the buzzer system, such that no active players are locked out and all active players are able to buzz in on the upcoming tossup.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">After </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the last cycle of regulation play, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">t</span><span style="font-weight:400;">he team with the higher score is declared the winner of the match. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event of a tie in score after regulation play, the teams will play</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> one or more</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> additional </span><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">sudden-death</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">tossups until the first change in score occurs, at which point the team with the higher score is immediately declared the winner.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>Because the game ends immediately with the first change in score, answering a tiebreaker tossup correctly does not earn a player's team a bonus</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">After the tenth cycle of a match, the moderator must pause for </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">halftime</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. Halftime shall last no longer than sixty seconds, unless more time is needed at the moderator's discretion to note the specifics of one or more protests (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"Protests"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). At halftime, the moderator must perform a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">score check</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> by announcing the official score, and reconciling discrepancies with players</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, coaches,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> or spectators who are keeping an unofficial score as needed. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Each team may take up to one </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">timeout</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> per game. A team may only take their timeout by declaring verbally, between cycles, that they are taking their timeout for the game </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>i.e. by saying "Timeout" or "Time"</em></span><span style="font-weight:400;">). Timeouts shall last no longer than thirty seconds. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">For each team, the moderator shall accept the first permissible call for a timeout which is directed at the moderator from any active player or coach on that team. Additional calls for a timeout beyond either team's first shall be ignored. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Attempts to call for a timeout within a cycle (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">i.e. while a tossup or bonus is being read; between a tossup and its corresponding bonus</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) shall be ignored. Calls for a timeout while a tossup is being read shall be treated as conferring (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See D.1</span><span style="font-weight:400;">1</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Except in cases of emergency, all players and coaches on both teams must remain within the game room during the duration of a timeout. If a participant does have to leave the game room for some genuine reason during a timeout and remains absent for more than thirty seconds, the moderator shall resume the match without the missing participant.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator will not pause the game at any point other than at halftime or during each team's designated timeout, except to accommodate emergencies or other reasonable requests at the moderator's discretion.</span></li>
</ol>

	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a player believes that their button or the buzzer system is malfunctioning, that player may say "Buzz" instead of buzzing in; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">saying "Buzz" in this manner shall be treated the same as buzzing in with the electronic buzzer system and does not constitute conferring.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> The decision of a moderator that this has occurred before or after another player buzzes in with the electronic buzzer system is a judgment call and is not protestable.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Moderator judgment as to whether conferring occurred is not protestable.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Irrespective of which button is held or used by which player, the player who buzzes in is the one who gets to give an answer. Attempting to "buzz in for" a teammate, such that one player buzzes in and a second player gives the answer, counts as conferring if the player who buzzes in and the player who gives the answer are not the same player.

<ol start="2">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator shall read one bonus part individually, and preside over timing, rule on </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers, etc. for that bonus part, before moving onto the next.

<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a team directs an answer toward the moderator while the moderator is still reading a bonus part, the moderator shall stop reading immediately and rule on the correctness of that given answer.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If two or more players on the same team give distinct answers to the same bonus part by directing them toward the moderator </span><span style="font-weight:400;">simultaneously</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, the moderator will ask the team to select one from among that set of answers as their official answer. The team must then select one answer immediately, or else be ruled incorrect. Moderator judgment as to what counts as simultaneous is not protestable. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Any attempt to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">amend</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the team's answer to a new one outside the set of initial simultaneously-directed answers will automatically be ruled incorrect</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section F, "Ruling on Answers"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">)</span></li>

<ol start="5">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If no team member directs an answer toward the moderator within four seconds, the moderator </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:400;">must</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> ask the team for an official answer (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. by saying "Answer?"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).

<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a player gives an answer at the same time that the moderator calls time, the tie is resolved in favor of the player.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that no correct answer is given, the moderator shall reveal the answer to each bonus part immediately after the last opportunity to give an answer for that bonus part expires. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">At the end of the bonus, the moderator should clearly state the total number(s) of points gained and immediately reconcile any discrepancies over the point total.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Bonuses are not tied to or related to specific tossups</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. The moderator should</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> always</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> read the next available bonus in the packet each time a new bonus needs to be read. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example: If the moderator is reading a packet of questions in which Tossups 1, 2, and 3 all go dead, but Tossup 4 is answered correctly, the moderator SHOULD read Bonus 1 to the team which earned it, and SHOULD NOT skip to Bonus 4</em>.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that the moderator skips over a bonus by accident, the moderator should go back and read the skipped-over bonus at the next opportunity in which a bonus needs to be read, then continue thereafter with the sequential order of bonuses presented by the packet.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that the moderator accidentally reveals the answer to a bonus part before </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a team</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> has its </span><span style="font-weight:400;">duly-permitted </span><span style="font-weight:400;">opportunity to answer, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the scorekeeper shall note the issue and the match will continue.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> If it is true after regulation play that the points thus removed could affect the win-loss outcome of the match, then a replacement bonus will be read after regulation play.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In all situations in which a bonus must be replaced, a new bonus will be read to the same controlling team, on which it shall not be possible to gain more points than the potential maximum if the error had not occurred, and it shall not be possible to gain fewer points than the total gained from the original bonus with error included.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, consider an original bonus with three parts worth 10 points each, on which the controlling team gives an incorrect answer to the first part, gives a correct answer to the second part, and cannot </span><span style="font-weight:400;">give an </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answer </span><span style="font-weight:400;">to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the third part due to moderator error, with no other factors involved. On the replacement bonus, that team can score no fewer than 10 points and no more than 20. Even if they give incorrect answers for all three parts of the replacement bonus, they will gain 10 points, because they already answered one part of the original bonus correctly and are not penalized out of those points by the moderator's error. Even if they give correct answers to all parts of the replacement bonus, they will gain 20 points, because they gave an incorrect answer to one part of the original bonus and do not get second chance at lost scoring opportunities unaffected by the moderator's error.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Before reading a replacement bonus, the moderator should state the range(s) of point values available and ensure that both teams understand the situation.</span></li>

<h1 id="h.p7cyzatwcqjn"><span style="font-weight:400;">F. Ruling on</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Answers</span></h1>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Whenever a player direct</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given answer</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> at the moderator, the moderator shall </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">rule on</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the correctness of that answer by determining whether it is correct [and thereby </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">accept</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ing it] </span><span style="font-weight:400;">or incorrect. Each tossup, and each bonus part, will specify a list of possible correct [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">acceptable</span><span style="font-weight:400;">; or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">desired</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] answers, and sometimes further instructions regarding related </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers </span><span style="font-weight:400;">or similar</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> possible</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> answers</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> or specific unacceptable answers</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, on an </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">answer line</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> immediately following the text of the question itself.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> In general, except in cases of immediately obvious factual errors or printing errors or omissions on the answer line, the moderator is to follow its instructions, as well as the Specific Correctness Guidelines below (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section G</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Moderators without particular subject-matter expertise are encouraged to trust that teams will protest if a factual issue beyond the moderator's understanding is at issue, rather than attempt to resolve it before any team indicates intent to lodge a protest. See Section H, "Protests".</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">When a player or team has the opportunity to give an answer, the first given answer which the moderator recognizes is the only answer that will be ruled on. Giving an answer involves completing at least one word that could uniquely identify a potential answer and then, if applicable, completing all other words of that potential answer without any unnatural pauses or pauses of longer than a second between words within that potential answer (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">disregarding embellishing; See F.8</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). A player who wishes to amend their given answer (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. to correct the pronunciation of a word, to change from one given answer to another</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) must do so, without any unnatural pause, before the moderator has ruled on any answer that player has given. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that an active player gives an answer to any kind of question and that given answer is ruled incorrect, the moderator shall note verbally that the given answer was incorrect without indicating any reason for that ruling </span><span style="font-weight:400;">while the question is still live</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>E.g.: It is not permitted to say "I can't accept that pronunciation," "You changed your answer three words in," "so close," etc</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In exception to the above, the moderator must expressly indicate when time is called and/or when a team engages in disallowed conferring. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Moderators should take care not to reveal whether instances of conferring included part or all of a correct answer.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If the moderator reveals the reason for ruling a given answer incorrect on a tossup and the opposing team still has a chance to answer that tossup, the team which buzzed in with the incorrect answer may request that the a replacement question be read for the opposing team only instead of the rest of the original tossup.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a player gives an answer which is not outright incorrect,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> but is nonetheless not specific enough to precisely identify the answer, the moderator must </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">prompt</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, asking the player for a more specific answer </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>e.g. "I need more," "More specific, please", "More," or simply "Prompt"</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, rather than ruling on it outright</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">A player (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">on a tossup</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) or team (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">on a bonus</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">part</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) has </span><span style="font-weight:400;">t</span><span style="font-weight:400;">hree seconds</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to give a more specific answer after being prompted. If the player or team responds by giving with a more specific answer which is still not as specific as is required, the moderator shall prompt again, allowing two more seconds for a still-more-specific answer, and will continue to do so an indefinite number of times so long as the given answers continue to have greater specificity in the direction of </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a/the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">desired answer to the question.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">While a bonus part is being played, the team that was prompted may confer as normal during their </span><span style="font-weight:400;">t</span><span style="font-weight:400;">hree seconds after being prompted. While a tossup is being played, conferring is not allowed even if the player who buzzed in has been prompted.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator will not ask again for an answer (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>i.e. may not say "Answer please," etc</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) during the three seconds following a prompt, regardless of whether the prompt </span><span style="font-weight:400;">occurs</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> on a tossup or bonus.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Some questions may have answer line instructions to the moderator to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">anti-prompt</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, asking the player for a less specific answer. </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>e.g. "Less specific," or simply "anti-prompt"</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. All rules regarding timing, conferring, etc. for anti-prompts are the same as those regarding prompts.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator may </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:400;">never</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> anti-prompt unless instructions on an answer line explicitly mandate doing so for the particular answer a player gave. Teams may nonetheless receive repeated anti-prompt instructions if their response upon being anti-prompted for one answer is to give another answer for which there are instructions to anti-prompt. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a player or team is anti-prompted and then responds with an answer which is even less specific than </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a/</span><span style="font-weight:400;">the desired answer to the question</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">i.e. goes from an over-specific given answer to an under-specific given answer</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, the moderator may (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">issue</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"> a "normal"</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span><span style="font-weight:400;">prompt.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The fact that a player was not anti-prompted for giving an inexact answer is not protestable.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> The absence of instructions to anti-prompt on an answer line is not protestable.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator may ask for a player to repeat a given answer before ruling on it if it was not possible to hear it clearly. If this occurs, the player may not change their answer in any way. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Attempting to take advantage of a moderator by changing </span><span style="font-weight:400;">to a different given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answer when asked to repeat an already-given answer is a form of misconduct (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section I</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator may ask for the player to spell their given answer before ruling on it if it would help the moderator distinguish the player's answer from other similar possible answers. If a player is asked to spell their answer, only letters which are essential for distinguishing the player's intended answer need to be correct. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example: A player who gives the answer "Monet" may be asked to spell it out so as to distinguish </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers indicating Claude Monet from </span><span style="font-weight:400;">possible </span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>answers indicating Edouard Manet. A player who spells out "M-O-N-A-Y", or who says "with an O", has succeeded at that task and will be ruled correct, without spelling skill or lack thereof affecting the correctness of the answer</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Embellishment of given answers will be disregarded unless it renders the given answer </span><span style="font-weight:400;">incorrect.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Hesitation markers around</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g. "Uh....uh...Descartes"</em>,</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) and</span><span style="font-weight:400;">/or</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the embedding of a</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> given</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> answer in a larger sentence (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. "this has to be the awesomely-named bomb calorimeter,</span><span style="font-weight:400;">"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em> "Who is Bram Stoker?"</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> will never in and of themselves render an answer incorrect. In any case, the player must give the first actual word of a potential answer before time is called, and does not gain extra time by saying filler words. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If a player embellishes their given answer, the determination as to which word is the first word of a potential answer is a matter of moderator judgment and is not protestable</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Phrases directed at the moderator which consist only of a negation of one possible answer will be ruled on as though the player directed that possible answer without the negation. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.  If a player directs the given answer </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"It's not Chaucer..." </span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>to the moderator, without saying any more, the moderator should rule on the given answer "Chaucer," including accepting it if "Chaucer" is an acceptable answer</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A player may give an answer which contains two or more pieces of related information of different types (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">such as both the title of a work and its creator</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), to be treated as a unified answer. If any one piece of information given in this way contains the answer being sought, and all such pieces of information are correctly and clearly related to one another in a factually accurate manner, the answer shall be ruled correct. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, "Homer's The Odyssey" is an acceptable answer if the answer being sought is either "The Odyssey" or "Homer" </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and the question has been describing the Odyssey as "this work"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>; "Aesop's The Odyssey" is not an acceptable answer for any question, as authorship of The Odyssey is not attributed to Aesop. Players are strongly discouraged from merely listing related pieces of information, and should try to produce all information in a unified grammatical phrase whenever possible</em>.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">When giving an answer to a tossup, any answer containing two or more pieces of related information must be applicable as of the clue on which the player buzzed in. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If multiple answers are required (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. a bonus part which asks players to "Name the two countries" which engaged in a particular war</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), all </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers </span><span style="font-weight:400;">except the last one </span><span style="font-weight:400;">must be </span><span style="font-weight:400;">completed and directed toward the moderator before time is called, and </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the last given answer must be started before time is called;</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> any answers given </span><span style="font-weight:400;">there</span><span style="font-weight:400;">after will be disregarded. Players will not be prompted for giving a list of answers which is shorter than the required number.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Players are not expected to know the exact pronunciation of every answer. Any reasonable attempt at pronouncing the answer being sought with the proper consonants in the proper order will be ruled correct, unless one or more vowels must be uniquely specified to distinguish the player's given answer from other possible given answers, in which case (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g. the "Manet" vs. "Monet" example presented in the reminder text of F.7</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, only the distinguishing vowel(s) need be correct. A player's given answer must not add any consonants which would not be visible while reading the answer in text form, and must not switch the order of any consonants. </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>For example, "Stend-HALE" or "STOON-dahl" are acceptable pronunciations if the desired answer is Stendhal, but "STED-nahl" or "STINK-dahl" are not</em>.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The syllable on which stress is placed in a player's answer will never in itself cause the answer to be ruled incorrect (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">even if the answer being sought has an accent mark specifying where the proper stress occurs</span><span style="font-weight:400;">). </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Players need not account for accent marks or diacritical marks in attempting a reasonable pronunciation of their given answers.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Moderators should make efforts to accommodate players with speech impediments or heavy accents, so that the intended pronunciation (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">or failing that, spelling</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) of each player's answer is not in doubt.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a consonant could be reasonably read to be silent, a player's answer will not be ruled incorrect for having left that consonant silent. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>E.g.: A player will not be ruled incorrect for saying "mah-NEY" instead of "mah-NET" if the desired answer is Manet</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>

	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless specified below as optional or "at the discretion of the answer line," these guidelines may be used to overrule or add to the printed substance of an answer line within a packet in the event of moderator judgment of how to rule on an answer or tournament director judgment about how to resolve a protest.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In cases where the correct answer to a question has an original name not in the English language, the original-language name is also acceptable, as are all common published English names and literal English translations of those names.</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"> (<em>E.g.: For Marcel Proust’s series "À la recherche du temps perdu," that original French title is acceptable, the literal translation "In Search of Lost Time" is acceptable, and the title "Remembrance of Things Past" is acceptable because the series was published under that name in English; however, "En búsqueda del tiempo perdido" is not acceptable, since Spanish is not the original language of the series</em>.)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Ambiguities across languages are resolved in favor of the player. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Ambiguities across languages as to the accuracy of a plausible translation will normally be resolved in favor of the player. Implausible or inaccurate translations are not acceptable. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, "A Dog’s Heart," "Heart of a Dog," "The Heart of a Dog," and "The Heart of the Dog" are all acceptable answers for the short story by Mikhail Bulgakov whose original Russian name is "Sobace serdtse," as the player is not expected to figure out whether or how to supply articles that do not exist in Russian. "The Heart Inside the Dog" is never acceptable, since there is no correct way to translate the Russian title in that way. Since moderators and tournament directors cannot be expected to be familiar with every foreign language, players are encouraged to give non-esoteric or traditional English translations, or the original-language title, whenever possible.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)
</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the desired answer to a question is a real, non-fictional person with a known family name, the player must </span><span style="font-weight:400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> give the family name of that real person to be ruled correct. Other names of that person may be provided in any order (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g.: "Proust, Marcel" and "Marcel Proust" are equally acceptable given answers</em>).</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> This rule applies irrespective of the proper ordering of names in the language or naming convention that the real person originates from. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example, modern Chinese naming conventions place the family name first. The burden is on the player to know which name is the family name and which is the individual's given name; given names alone are never acceptable answers for a real person</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In exception to the above rule, when the answer is a ruler within a series in which each person has a regnal name and/or number, the player need only give the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">regnal name and number (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">if there is a number</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span><span style="font-weight:400;">of that ruler, without specifying a family name or dynastic house name. (<em>E</em></span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">.g. "Pope Francis" is an acceptable answer for the pope who was elected in 2013, and "John" [without specifying number or family name] is an acceptable answer for the king of England who agreed to the Magna Carta</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, as there has only been one King John of England</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> "Henry VIII" [without specifying Tudor as the family name] is an acceptable answer for the king of England who died in 1547; saying just "Henry" is sufficient for a prompt but is not acceptable outright, as it does not uniquely identify any of the eight people named Henry who held the English monarchy.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If a person's family name combines two names using a hyphen (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. "Levi-Strauss"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), the names on either side of the hyphen must be given in the proper order for the given answer to be acceptable, and neither name on either side of the answer may be prompted on. If a person's family name combines two words without a hyphen </span><span style="font-weight:400;">all such words must be given in the proper order for the given answer to be acceptable, unless otherwise specified below or by the answer line (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. "George" is not acceptable if the sought-after surname is "Lloyd George"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> If a person's family name contains one or more nobiliary particles at the beginning (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. the "van" in "van Buren," the "de" in "de Cervantes"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), players need only give those particles which are necessary for specifying the surname within English-language common usage. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g. "Buren" is not an acceptable given answer for the historical person Martin van Buren, but "Cervantes" is an acceptable given answer for the historical person Don Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</em>.)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">For</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> lengthy Spanish-language surnames</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, the family name inherited from the person's father is generally a sufficient acceptable answer if given alone. In exception to the above, "Picasso" alone is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Pablo Ruiz y Picasso; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">"Marquez" is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Gabriel Garcia Marquez; and "Lorca" is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Federico Garcia Lorca.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If a person's family name changed over the course of his or her life (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. by marrying into a different family</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), any family name which that person had over the course of life is equally acceptable. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If a person changed both given name(s) and family name(s) at once, given names and family names may not be mixed and matched across the name change. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g. "Leslie Lynch Ford" is not an acceptable answer for the person who was born Leslie Lynch King and later changed his name to Gerald Ford.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If a single person is commonly known by a pseudonym or pen name which corresponds uniquely to that person, that pseudonym is acceptable in place of the person's family name. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example: "Mary Ann Evans" and "George Eliot" are always both acceptable ways for the player to give an answer to a question whose desired answer is the author of Middlemarch</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) If multiple people share a pseudonym in a shared context, and the desired answer is the pseudonym, none of the individual users of that pseudonym is an acceptable answer in its own right. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">F<em>or example, the answer "Alexander Hamilton" is not acceptable if a question asks for the shared pseudonym of the authors of the Federalist Papers.</em></span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If two or more people from the same era or family share a surname, or if two people from the same general context or category share a surname, an answer line may dictate that the player give more than just the last name to uniquely identify the desired person. The choice of whether or not to require additional information in this way is at the discretion of the answer line. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g: This may occur to distinguish the answer lines "ANSWER: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ary Godwin </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Shelley</span><span style="font-weight:400;">" and "ANSWER: </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">P</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ercy Bysshe </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold;">Shelley</span><span style="font-weight:400;">".</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If two or more people from the same family share both their given name and their surname, and each could be a plausible given answer, the player's given answer must unambiguously refer to one of those people by some means which rules out the other. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, by using "the Elder" or "the Younger,"</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">or by giving a middle name or nickname which the two people do not share.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) The choice of whether to require "Junior" or "Senior" is at the discretion of the answer line.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The only acceptable answer for the second president of the United States is "John Adams." Given answers referring to the sixth president of the United States, John Quincy Adams, must include reference to his middle name (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">'Q' is sufficient for this purpose</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">); "John Adams" is always an outright unacceptable answer if the full desired answer is "John Quincy Adams".</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In cases where a person came from an era </span><span style="font-weight:400;">or society</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in which surnames did/do not exist as they do in contemporary standard form, reasonably common identifications of a person by given name are acceptable. This includes situations where the only surname is one identifying a person by place of origin (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g. "Leonardo" is acceptable for "Leonardo da Vinci"</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Other cases where a person's work or accomplishments result in their being typically referred to by </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a distinctive, uncommon </span><span style="font-weight:400;">given name alone (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. "Oprah" for "Oprah Winfrey"</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, "Rembrandt" for "Rembrandt van Rijn"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), or cases in which a very common way of referring uniquely to a person deviates from the guidelines above, are at the discretion of the answer line.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Acceptable answers for fictional characters include the character's personal or first name, family name, and/or commonly-used nickname(s) appearing in the work(s) containing that character, as long as such information is sufficient to uniquely identify the character within that character's </span><span style="font-weight:400;">fictional universe.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the correct answer to a question is a religious or mythical figure appearing in multiple religious or mythological traditions, acceptable answers are limited to the names of that figure in specific traditions which have been identified, either explicitly or by reference to character names found only within those traditions, in the question text up to the point at which the player buzzed in.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">This generalizes, and includes, the situation of deities who have different names in Greek and Roman mythology. </span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example: "Zeus" is not acceptable if a question's desired answer is "Jupiter" and it uses clues found only in Roman mythology and ritual</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In exception to the above, the names of characters presented in common English-language translations of the Bible are always acceptable for those characters. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example, players need not give the Quranic or Arabic version of names when a question uses clues only from Islamic tradition about a character who is also found in the Bible</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless the player states otherwise, all dates in answers given by the player are assumed to be from the years AD/CE on the Gregorian calendar. If a player's answer contains a year within the past one hundred calendar years, inclusive of the year in which the match is being played, it is only necessary to give the final two digits of that year; otherwise, all digits are required. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example: "63" is an acceptable answer if the desired correct answer is "1963", but it is not an acceptable answer if the desired correct answer is "1763".</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In cases where the desired correct answer to a question is the title of a work, the player must generally give the full title of the work for their given answer to be acceptable. The moderator is never allowed to prompt if the player gives only part of a title.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In exception to the above, when giving an answer which is a title, players may omit the leading article "The," "An," or "A" from a title which has any single one of those articles as its first word (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: "Red Badge of Courage" is as acceptable as "The Red Badge of Courage"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Players may not add a leading article where a title has none, or supply an incorrect leading article, or else the entire given answer becomes unacceptable. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If pronunciation leaves it ambiguous whether a player is adding the article "A" or merely embellishing (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>"uh..."</em></span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section F.8</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), the moderator should assume that the player is embellishing rather than adding a leading article.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In cases where a work is</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> commonly published under</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> an abbreviated title, the abbreviated title under which it is published is acceptable in place of the full title. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g.: The answer "The Wealth of Nations" is as acceptable as "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations."</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Players are never required to give the subtitle(s) of a work if the desired answer is a title. A subtitle on its own is never an acceptable answer to give in place of the title. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g.: "What You Will" is never an acceptable answer for the Shakespeare play "Twelfth Night: Or, What You Will"</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the desired answer is a person or an organization which has a known acronym or abbreviation in common usage (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: "LBJ" for Lyndon Baines Johnson, "HHS" for the Department of Health and Human Services</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), the acronym is acceptable. Contrived or rare acronyms (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: "GWB" for George Walker Bush</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) are not acceptable. If an acronym or abbreviation could refer to two plausible organizations (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. "NRA" for National Rifle Association or National Recovery Association</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) , it is at the discretion of the answer line whether to prompt on, outright accept, or outright not accept the shared acronym.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless an answer line permits otherwise, the chemical symbol is never acceptable when the desired answer is a chemical element. If the desired answer is a specific molecule or chemical compound, IUPAC names and common names are typically both acceptable; the chemical formula for a compound is only an acceptable answer if the formula uniquely identifies that one compound and reciting the formula in full would not constitute unsportsmanlike delay of game or any other kind of misconduct.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless an answer line permits otherwise, a symbol representing a physical or mathematical quantity is not acceptable in place of the common-usage verbal name of that quantity, unless the predominantly common way of naming that quantity is by speaking the name of its symbol aloud. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g.: "U" is usually not an acceptable answer in place of "potential energy," but "e" is usually an acceptable answer in place of "Euler's number"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">.)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless an answer line permits otherwise, the letter abbreviations for nucleotides and nucleobases, the three-letter abbreviations for amino acids, and the codon or anticodon sequences corresponding to an amino acid are not acceptable answers in place of the common names for those types of biochemical objects.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the desired answer is a musical note or key from a specific piece of music or musical context, the player's given answer must match that note or key "as written" even if other possible answers are enharmonically or technically equivalent. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example, if a question asks the player to give the answer "E-flat" in describing the key of a symphony, "D-sharp" is not acceptable, even though D-sharp and E-flat represent the same pitch class in different contexts</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)  </span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the desired answer is a state, province, country, or school, there is no need to embellish beyond the common proper name of the place, except in cases where an unmodified place name is not uniquely identifying. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, it is never necessary to give "Harvard University" or "Republic of Zimbabwe" as one's answer, rather than just "Harvard" or "Zimbabwe," respectively, but one must specify "Boston University" or "Boston College" rather than just "Boston" to identify either of those two schools</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, as they are distinct entities</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In cases where a player gives the unmodified answer "China," it is assumed that the player is referring to the government or country whose territory is in mainland China, and not solely to the island of Taiwan or the government based in Taiwan.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless question text specifically requires or requests them, postal abbreviations, national aircraft registration prefixes, etc. are not acceptable answers in place of the common name of a state, province, or country.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">For questions where the desired answer is a place, the correctness of various historical names for that place is determined by whether a clue in the question has specified the era in which that historical place name was current, up to the point at which the player buzzed in. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If no clue can be used to specify a past time period and all clues are in present tense, it is assumed by default that only place names used in the present day are acceptable.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">For example: "Rhodesia" is not an acceptable answer for a question on the contemporary nation of Zimbabwe if all clues given refer to Zimbabwe.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless the answer line permits otherwise, "Russia" is not an acceptable answer to a question if all clues which have been read refer to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics between 1917 and 1991. </span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless the answer line permits otherwise, "England" is not an acceptable answer to a question if all clues which have been read refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain from 1707 to the present.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">For United States appellate (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">including Supreme Court</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) cases, either party name is acceptable alone unless exactly one party is "United States" or a particular state, county, city, jurisdiction, etc., in which case the other party name must be given. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g.: either "Gibbons" or "Ogden" is sufficient to identify the case Gibbons v. Ogden, but "Miranda" is required for Miranda v. Arizona, and an answer of "Arizona" will not be accepted or prompted for any case in which the state of Arizona is a party</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"><em>.</em>) When giving the full name of the case, any order of party names is acceptable (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: "Gibbons v. Ogden" is just as acceptable as "Ogden v. Gibbons"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). Widely known informal nicknames for specific court cases (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">such as "the Sick Chicken Case"</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) are acceptable answers unless the answer line indicates otherwise. Docketing numbers are never acceptable.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the correct answer for a given question has an answer which is a common number or derived mathematical formula, and the player's given answer </span><span style="font-weight:400;">expresse</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s the desired number or formula without specifying units, the moderator will assume the player's answer is in the proper units. If the player </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">does </span><span style="font-weight:400;">give an answer specifying the units, the unit specified must be correct. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">e<em>.g: If the full desired answer is "2 meters per second," the player may give "2" as an acceptable answer, but "2 miles per hour" is not acceptable.</em></span><span style="font-weight:400;">) Answers which require converting the desired numerical answer into other unit systems (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. giving the proper conversion of a meters-per-second answer into the equivalent amount in miles per hour</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) are not acceptable unless expressly permitted by an answer line.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the correct answer for a question has an acceptable quantitative answer which is a fraction, players must give that fraction in simplest terms, or as the simplest available decimal or percent representation. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g.: "four-eighths" is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "one-half"</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If the correct answer for a question has a non-terminating decimal or is an irrational or transcendental number, s</span><span style="font-weight:400;">uch that saying the full number aloud is impossible to do in finite time</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, players must give a finitely-long way of referring to that number as their answer. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g.: "3 point 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5..." is never an acceptable answer in place of "pi".</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="16">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless otherwise permitted by the answer line or by question text, descriptive phrases are not acceptable answers when the desired answer is a person, thing, or phenomenon with a defined name or nomenclature. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>E.g.: "Uh, the current Pope" is not acceptable when the desired answer is "Pope Francis"</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">If there are multiple acceptable answers</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a question, each answer is equally acceptable unless one of those potential answers is mentioned in a clue within the question text and the moderator has begun reading that potential answer aloud. For the purposes of this rule, "begun" means that the moderator has finished reading the full syllable</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> just prior to the potential answer</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>E.g.: If "Samuel Clemens" is an acceptable answer up to a point, and a clue within a question reads "originally named Samuel Clemens," it stops being acceptable as soon as the moderator finishes articulating the /d/ sound in "named"</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless an answer line expressly allows otherwise, a player's given answer must contain the proper word form(s) which could refer directly to the answer -- a proper noun if the desired answer is a proper noun, an adjective if the desired answer is an adjective, etc. -- and an answer which merely contains another word or phrase derived from the desired answer is not acceptable on its own. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">E.g.: "Freudian slip" alone is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "Sigmund Freud," and "spoonerism" is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Reverend William</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em> Spooner," unless the answer line permits it.</em>)</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">

<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">protest</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is an official action taken by an active player or coach to ensure that possible errors do not disrupt the proper and consistent awarding of points for accurate and specific factual knowledge. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Any active player or coach may</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> indicate their interest</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in formally lodging a protest while a match is ongoing, at any pause between questions prior to the point at which that protest would need to be formally lodged (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>e.g. by quickly and unobtrusively saying "Protest" if it regards the question which was just read, or by quickly and unobtrusively saying "Protest on tossup 7", say, if it regards a question from earlier in the game</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) The moderator shall note immediately that this indication of interest was made (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g. by saying "Noted" and marking the spot corresponding to that question/cycle on the official scoresheet</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), and then continue reading the next question.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Indicating interest in formally lodging a protest does not constitute formally lodging that protest.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Any active player or coach may formally </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">lodge</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a protest by stating that they are lodging a protest and explaining the specific substance of the protest. Protests concerning a tossup or bonus within the first ten cycles of a match may only be lodged at halftime. Protests concerning a tossup or bonus between the end of halftime and the end of regulation play may only be lodged </span><span style="font-weight:400;">within one minute after regulation play (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">though the stating or writing of an explanation of the protest may take longer than a minute if necessary</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Protests on any tiebreaker question may and must be lodged immediately after the affected question has been played.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Active players who are being substituted out must lodge a protest before the substitution occurs. Players who have just been substituted in may not lodge a protest regarding a question that was read when they were non-active.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The opportunity to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">start lodging</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> protests ends for</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> a given match </span><span style="font-weight:400;">as soon as a</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ll members of one team</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">have</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> left the game room</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Before the last opportunity to lodge protests for a given game has concluded, the opposing team to any individual protest may </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">concede</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the validity of a protest, in which case the game state is immediately changed as though that protest were upheld (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See H.12</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), and/or the protesting team may </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">withdraw</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> its own protest, in which case the game state remains as though that protest were denied.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The following potential errors, and only the following, are protestable:</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The protesting player gave an answer which is factually correct and acceptable given the rules and guidelines regarding correctness of answers, and that given answer was not accepted.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">This protest may be lodged either in instances of obvious answer line error, such as a tossup on World War II whose listed answer is "Lewis Carroll," or in instances where an always-acceptable alternative answer, such as the original-language title or a plausible pronunciation given English phonetics, is not listed in the answer line or known to be acceptable by the moderator. See Section F, "Ruling on Answers," and Section G, "Detailed Correctness Guidelines".</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The question text is ambiguous such that, given the entirety of the question text that was read out, the answer the player gave is correct and would reasonably be accepted by an otherwise knowledgeable person without access to the answer line. This type of protest cannot be lodged until</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> at least one clue has been read out in full.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(On a tossup, this protest can only be lodged regarding the question text that was read before the affected player buzzed in. See A.7.a regarding what constitutes a clue; this type of protest cannot be lodged unless the moderator has read a set of words that could reasonably be construed as a grammatical sentence, even if a conjunction, semicolon, etc. links that clue to others.</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The listed acceptable answer in the packet was unreasonably specific, and the player gave an unlisted answer which reasonably uniquely identifies the same thing as the listed answer. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The tossup or bonus part has no single correct answer, either because distinct clues have been read that </span><span style="font-weight:400;">each </span><span style="font-weight:400;">uniquely identify</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">two or more di</span><span style="font-weight:400;">stinct</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">non-interchangeable </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answers</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, or because all clues which have been read thus far are factually erroneous, or because clues which have been read thus far fundamentally misidentify the sort of thing the desired answer is (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: repeatedly says "this element" when the desired answer is a chemical compound</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The player gave a correct but not sufficiently specific answer, and should have been prompted, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>This includes, but is not limited to, cases in which the answer line included a prompt instruction that the moderator did not see, or in which the guidelines in Section G would normally provide for a prompt that the moderator did not give</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The opposing</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> team gained points for an answer which</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> should </span><span style="font-weight:400;">have been ruled incorrect, but was ruled correct due either to moderator error or to an error in the packet. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Nothing else is protestable.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">"</span><span style="font-weight:400;">What the moderator heard" is not protestable. In cases where both teams agree that the moderator ruled mistakenly on an answer based on a hearing error, they may bring this to the moderator's attention and the moderator will re-evaluate the answer which was actually given. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Procedural </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">complaint</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s are not protests. If a participant on either team notices that a game official has made a mistake in adhering to the procedures laid out in these rules, that participant may bring the mistake to the moderator's attention between the reading of one question and the next; the moderator shall then note the issue and determine immediately how to proceed from that point onward. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Some examples of situations that might warrant a procedural complaint include: giving players a one-second warning on tossups, See C.9; failing to give a bounceback opportunity in the event that bouncebacks are being used at the tournament, See Section EX; taking a given answer directed by the wrong player, See Section D; improvising clues not provided in the packet or giving extra hints after all clues to a question have been read, See C.16.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) A procedural complaint is never grounds to "restart" the game or replace any questions outside the ongoing cycle or, if it arises between cycles, outside the most recently concluded cycle.</span></li>
</ol>
<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Moderator judgment calls of any kind, such as timing calls, rulings that a buzz was accidental, discovery of conferring, and the levying of sanctions for misconduct, are never protestable.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The mere fact that a single clue or combination of clues could, in a vacuum, refer to multiple possible answers is not protestable, unless all clues up to the point at which a player buzzed in could refer specifically to the answer the player gave.)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Subjective opinions about the quality of a question, including that a clue was "too early" or "too easy," or that a clue was vague or poorly-phrased or unhelpful, or that a clue was difficult to understand due to grammatical stylistic choices, or that a question was "bad," etc. etc. are never grounds for protest.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The failure of a question to be of a specific category, or the failure of the questions in a match to conform to an expected "distribution" of categories -- e.g., "this round only had three science tossups" -- is not protestable.)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">The mere fact that the answer given by a player is related to the clues in a question, or related to the actual answer of the question, is not protestable. In particular, players may not protest that the answer they gave "is associated with" the clues they heard unless they can specify an issue of factual accuracy under the legitimate grounds for protest listed above.)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(The mere presence of a minor factual error is not protestable if that error creates no ambiguity with regard to the desired answer, based on a knowledgeable person's correction of the error. For example: there are no grounds for protest if question text states "The author of the novel Snow Country</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Kenzaburo Oe, is from this country," as both the actual author of Snow Country and Kenzaburo Oe are both from Japan, and either way of rectifying the error would uniquely identify the desired answer of Japan.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><span style="font-weight:400;">A team may not protest that the opposing team gave an answer which was accepted but should merely have been prompted; e.g. Team A cannot protest that Team B's answer of "Freud" should have required a prompt in the hopes of the more specific answer "Sigmund Freud".</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></em>

<em><span style="font-weight:400;">(A team cannot protest that the other team was prompted, except in cases where giving a prompt on an outright incorrect or unacceptable answer results on an unwarranted chance at points.)</span></em>
<ol start="7">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Multiple protests may be lodged concerning the same question.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">There is no limit to the number of protests a team may lodge during a match. The moderator may judge the excessive lodging of frivolous protests, or the excessive indication of intent to protest, to be misconduct (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See Section I</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">While lodging a protest, a team may cite academic sources or resources as needed as evidence for their protest, provided that no player or coach uses any forbidden electronic devices or printed notes/sources while there are still questions yet to read in the game. Citation of, or lookup within, at-hand print or electronic sources after the game to strengthen the rationale for a protest before that protest is reported to the tournament director does not in and of itself constitute cheating, tampering, or any other form of misconduct (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See I.5</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Unless the tournament director dictates otherwise, a</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> protest will be </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">resolve</span><span style="font-weight:400;">d if and only if</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> resolving that protest could change the win-loss outcome of the match.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Protests which must be resolved are also known as </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">pending</span><span style="font-weight:bold;"> protest</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) </span><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that one or more protests need to be resolved from </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a particular </span><span style="font-weight:400;">match, the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">moderator shall report the specifics of all such protests to the tournament director, and the tournament director shall ensure proper resolution of each protest from that point on</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> All protests whose resolution could not change the win-loss outcome of the match are rendered </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">moot</span><span style="font-weight:400;">; moot protests are not relayed or resolved. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event that a match has a tied score after regulation play and protests have been lodged which could affect the outcome so as to make the match not a tie upon being resolved, the teams should play through the usual tiebreaker procedure until the match has a winner before any protests are resolved.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> If the reading of tiebreaker questions determines a winner such that lodged protests would not change the win-loss outcome of the game, those protests become moot and need not be resolved</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See C.6</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a match was tied after regulation play, and then a protest from regulation play is upheld, such that the score after regulation play is no longer a tie, all tiebreaker questions and changes in score from any tiebreaker questions are undone prior to other procedures for upholding the protest (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See C.6</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">).</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The tournament director has the ultimate authority to resolve all pending protests; this authority allows for delegating the resolution of protests to another individual official or to a committee, whether that be for the duration of the tournament or on a case-by-case basis.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The tournament director may request or mandate that all protests be delivered by the use of </span><span style="font-weight:400;">written sheets </span><span style="font-weight:400;">on which the substance of the protest is explained by each team affected, rather than by a verbal report of the circumstances from the moderator.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The report of a protest to the tournament director or the tournament director's delegates </span><span style="font-weight:400;">should never, under any circumstances, disclose the specific team which protested a question</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. If possible, all information about the specific teams involved in a protest should be redacted when the protest is reported.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The tournament director's authority to resolve pending protests, and any authority delegated by the tournament director to other people, includes the authority to choose the order in which protests from a single match are resolved in the event that there are multiple protests. If resolving some number of protests within a match renders the remaining protests moot, those mooted protests need not be resolved, irrespective of when they were lodged during the match.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A protest can be resolved in one of two ways:</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> it can be </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">denied</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> or it can be </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">upheld</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. If a protest is denied, all original scoring on the affected question(s) remains unchanged. If a protest is upheld, the moderator shall follow the procedures below to restore the condition of the game as though the error had not been made.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(<em>Resolution A</em>)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If the protest resolution determines that a player gave a correct answer which was erroneously ruled incorrect (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See </span><span style="font-weight:400;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.5.a; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.5.b; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.5.c</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), all existing score changes due the affected tossup or bonus part will be </span><span style="font-weight:400;">undone</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</span><span style="font-weight:400;">), and the player's team will be given the proper number of points for a correct answer.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> In the event that the incorrect-to-correct change is made regarding a tossup answer, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">both teams will be reseated as soon as is practicable, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">a bonus will be read to the player's team</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, and all points scored on that bonus will be added to the final score</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Resolution B</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) If the protest resolution determines that there was no possible correct answer to a</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">tossup or bonus part (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See </span><span style="font-weight:400;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.5.d</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), the question will be thrown out, all score changes due to the affected question will be </span><span style="font-weight:400;">undone</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, and a replacement question</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> of the same kind</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, tossup or bonus,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">will be read to the same team or teams which were eligible to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">give an </span><span style="font-weight:400;">answer before.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> In the event that a tossup is replaced in this way and the replacement tossup is correctly answered by same team which correctly answered the original tossup, the bonus points from the original bonus are maintained, rather than reading a new bonus; otherwise, a new bonus will be read as necessary to go along with a replacement tossup as soon as is practicable.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Any replacement tossup read in keeping with Resolution B is read to both teams. In the event that a single bonus part is invalidated by Resolution B, an entire replacement bonus is read in accordance with Rule E.10.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Resolution C</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) If the protest resolution determines that a player or team should have been prompted on a bonus part, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">See </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">.5.e</span><span style="font-weight:400;">), the original bonus will be thrown out and a replacement bonus will be read </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">(See E.10</span><span style="font-weight:400;">). If the protest resolution determines that a player or team should have been prompted on a tossup, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted, the original tossup will be thrown out and a replacement tossup will be read to the protesting team, on which the opposing team may not buzz in. In the event of a replacement tossup, all</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> original scoring f</span><span style="font-weight:400;">rom the protested cycle will stand (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">including any points earned on the bonus within that cycle</span><span style="font-weight:400;">) unless the protesting team gives a correct answer to the replacement tossup; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">if the protesting team gives a correct answer to the replacement tossup,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> it earns a bonus</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> so as to complete a new replacement cycle, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">all changes in score from the originally-protested cycle are undone, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and any new score changes from the replacement cycle </span><span style="font-weight:400;">are included in the official score</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">(</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Resolution D</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) If the protest resolution determines that the opposing team was ruled correct for a given answer which was incorrect (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">See </span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">H</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">.5.f</span><span style="font-weight:400;">), </span><span style="font-weight:400;">all changes in score due to the affected question or part will be </span><span style="font-weight:400;">undone (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</span><span style="font-weight:400;">). In the event that the affected question is a tossup and the protesting team </span><span style="font-weight:400;">lost an opportunity to buzz in due to the error which led to the protest</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, a replacement tossup will be read which only the protesting team may play. </span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="13">
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If the resolution of a protest creates a tie in score where there was no tie before, the teams will play tiebreaker questions under the usual procedure. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See C.6</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;"><em>.</em>)</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">If a protest resolution results in a replacement tossup taking the place of a pre-existing tiebreaker tossup for which no corresponding bonus is awarded, no bonus is awarded for answering that replacement tossup correctly either.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The decision of whether to hold teams in the game room while a protest is being resolved, or to let those teams advance to their next match(<em>es</em>) (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">conveying the protest resolution to those teams later on</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, is at the tournament director's discretion.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">The decision of whether or not to let moderators conduct </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">provisional gameplay</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">hypothetical gameplay</span><span style="font-weight:400;">] before protests are officially resolved is at the discretion of the tournament director. Provisional gameplay consists of reading any replacement or additional questions which would be required in the event that pending protest(s) are upheld, and taking note of the changes in score that result. In the event that some or all of the pending protest(s) are indeed upheld, the corresponding score changes from hypothetical gameplay are made official. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">A protest is considered resolved once its resolution has been conveyed to both teams. No team may attempt to communicate to the tournament director or the tournament director's delegates about the ongoing resolution of a protest prior to receiving word about the official resolution from tournament staff. Attempting to tamper with the resolution of a protest while it is ongoing is a form of severe misconduct (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">See I.5.e</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">). </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight:400;">All protests which require a resolution will be resolved exactly one time. All protest resolutions are final. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">No protest resolution may be reversed, appealed, or revisited at any time, for any reason.</span></li>

	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">All </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">spectator</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s [or </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">audience member</span><span style="font-weight:400;">s] who watch a match must be physically separated from all active players and game officials, and may not speak, make deliberate noise, or attempt to communicate nonverbally with active players or game officials while a match is ongoing.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The moderator has the authority to eject any spectator(s) from a game room while the match is ongoing after just one instance of misconduct, without any prior warning.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">In particular, spectators may not encourage either team to lodge a protest. Spectators may not relay outside information (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;">such as information looked up on a mobile electronic device</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to players or coaches for the purpose of lodging protests or for any other reason.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Misconduct</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">consists of any behavior which violates the expected respect, courtesy, and ethical obligations required for duly conducting a quizbowl match. The moderator shall have authority to remark upon instances of misconduct as they occur, and sanction them as permitted below, even if it would require pausing the match to do so.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Under no circumstances shall points be deducted from the score of a team within a match, or added to the opposing team's score, to punish a participant or team for engaging in misconduct. The score of a quizbowl match can only be changed by the giving of answers to questions or by the resolution of protests.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Minor misconduct</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> consists of any behavior which briefly disrupts the ability for a match to continue smoothly, efficiently, and fairly. The moderator has the authority and discretion to provide a </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">warning</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to any participant in a match for their first instance of minor misconduct within that match, and may eject any participant from the room for the remainder of the match for a second or later instance of minor misconduct within that match.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Examples of minor misconduct include the use of </span><span style="font-weight:400;">psychological ploys</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> to confuse or misdirect the opposing team or the moderator, the deliberate making of disruptive noise (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">in ways not governed elsewhere in these rules by prohibitions on conferring</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">), the use of malicious or disrespectful language toward another participant in the match, or the use of epithets insulting a participant's race, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, etc.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The lodging of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">frivolous</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> protests, either through repeated lodging of protests regarding matters which are not protestable or through excessive lodging of allowed types of protests on extremely tenuous or speculative factual grounds, constitutes minor misconduct.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Unsportsmanlike delay of game</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, such as deliberately giving the longest acceptable answer to every question, making requests for score checks after every cycle, etc. constitutes minor misconduct if, in the view of the moderator, it interferes with the swift and timely completion of the match. It never constitutes unsportsmanlike delay of game to use any and all time allotted by these rules to think before giving an answer, or to do so at every available opportunity.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Severe misconduct</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> constitutes any behavior which threatens the very fairness and safety required for quizbowl, as an activity and a community, to continue. The tournament director has the authority to eject any participant from the tournament immediately for one instance of severe misconduct, or for a pattern of lesser misconduct over the course of the day. All decisions by the tournament director regarding ejections are final and may not be appealed.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Any physical </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">violence</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, attempted physical violence, or physical intimidation committed by any player, coach, spectator, or game official against any player, coach, spectator, game official, or tournament director, or designated assistant of the tournament director, or any </span><span style="font-weight:bold;">des</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">t</span><span style="font-weight:bold;">ruction of property</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, be that equipment used in the match or destruction or defacing of property within the game room or host institution,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">constitutes</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> severe misconduct.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cheating</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, defined as any attempt by a competing team member or coach to access question content before it is read out in the proper match, or any deliberate attempt outside the rules to access external information about the potential answers to questions while they are being read, or any use of an ineligible person as a participant, constitutes severe misconduct. (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">Use of disallowed personal electronic devices, reference sources, or notes while a match is ongoing constitutes cheating</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Outside a tournament itself, conversations about specific question content between a person who has not played a question set with a person who has already played that question set constitute cheating. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Playing one question set at a second tournament after already playing it once elsewhere constitutes cheating; the burden is on each team to keep track of which question sets it has already played and where</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. If a team at a tournament realizes that it has inadvertently already played a question set on which it is competing, that team must immediately report the issue and forfeit all remaining matches at that tournament.</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) All participants in a match or tournament share responsibility in reporting instances where cheating may have occurred, and are expected to cooperate fully in investigations of potential cheating.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Throwing a match</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><span style="font-weight:400;">defined as any attempt by one or more participants to set the winner and loser of a match before that match is played, or to fix the relative standings of teams at a tournament or subcomponent of a tournament before it has concluded, constitutes severe misconduct</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. All teams are expected to play honestly and to the best of their ability with the aim of winning each game, irrespective of the place of any other team(s) in the tournament standings or any other factor. Automatic forfeits of a scheduled match due to one team's absence from the tournament, medical emergency, and irreparable scenarios of that sort do not constitute throwing a match.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Extreme partiality </span><span style="font-weight:400;">of game officials,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> such as grossly unfair or inequitable application of these rules in favor of one team or school, or attempts to unduly influence the officiation of a match in favor of one team or school, or other behavior which compromises the effective neutrality of a game official between competing teams, constitutes severe misconduct. Any player or coach present for a match may report instances of extreme partiality to the tournament director or, if the tournament director </span><span style="font-weight:400;">is not available</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, to another game official. The tournament director has the authority to dismiss and/or replace game officials who are found to demonstrate extreme partiality.</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tampering</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> </span><span style="font-weight:400;">with tournament director decisions, including seeking out the tournament director to argue for a favorable protest resolution for one's team while a protest is still under review, intimidating tournament officials into changing the schedule of matches, entering into a designated staff-only room without invitation, etc. constitutes severe misconduct. Pointing out an earnest mistake (</span><em><span style="font-weight:400;">e.g.: one team is slated to be in two places at once</span></em><span style="font-weight:400;">) does not constitute tampering.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The current or past institutional affiliations of a game official, or lack thereof, are never in and of themselves sufficient cause to allege misconduct. (</span><span style="font-weight:400;text-decoration:italic;"><em>For example, if the moderator is a current student, alumnus/a, or faculty member of one of the schools competing in a match, the other school does not have grounds to allege extreme partiality or demand a replacement moderator on that grounds alone</em>.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">)</span></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-weight:400;">At the discretion of the tournament director, either while a tournament is ongoing or afterward, the results of matches in which severe misconduct was found to occur may be changed to forfeits. Teams with just one member who has engaged in severe misconduct may be removed from further contention at that tournament in such a way as the tournament director sees fit.</span></li>

<h1 id="h.g4yj4yl9zeml"><em>(About These Rules)</em></h1>
<em>(This is the official set of gameplay rules of the Academic Competition Federation, put forward for use at all official ACF events and at other applicable collegiate or collegiate-style quizbowl events. Eligibility information specifically pertaining to ACF events now exists as the ACF Official Eligibility Rules, and is no longer covered by this document.</em>

Within these rules, all plain text has the effective force of a rule governing all participants within a quizbowl match or tournament. The initial use of an important rules term, at the point where that term is most clearly defined, is given in <b>bold</b> [with alternate rules terms for that same thing bolded within <b>square brackets</b>]. In places where examples or clarifying "reminder text" might be useful, but not strictly necessary, to understanding the rules, that reminder text has been presented within parentheses in italics, as it is here.

These rules were ratified as a full replacement of the hitherto-existing rule set on August 27, 2016. Some portions of these rules were, with permission, based on the official gameplay rules of the Partnership for Academic Competition Excellence (PACE), and on the previous copyrighted rule sets of PACE and ACF.

Any tournament may use these rules free of charge without prior permission from ACF. However, tournament directors are expected to announce in advance any adjustments, choices, or modifications they might make to alter these rules at their own events, and to apply any such modifications consistently across all matches in a given tournament, without attributing authorship of any such modifications to ACF.)
<h1 id="h.3ql6qbk7cphr">A. Definitions and Participants</h1>
<ol>
	<li>A <b>tournament</b> is a set of organized quizbowl matches. The <b>tournament director</b> is the designated on-site organizer of a particular tournament.</li>
	<li>Each quizbowl match is played in a game room by two teams.</li>
	<li>Each game room shall have a <b>moderator</b>, who reads the questions to the two teams playing matches in that game room, and a <b>scorekeeper</b>, who records the official score on an official scoresheet as a match progresses. It is permissible for a single person to fulfill both the role of moderator and the role of scorekeeper for a game room.
<ol type="a">
	<li>At the tournament director's discretion, additional officials with other roles <em>(e.g. a person keeping unofficial score on a blackboard or whiteboard for the benefit of spectators)</em> may be appointed to help manage a game room or to help manage the tournament as a whole.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>A <b>team</b> consists of a roster of no fewer than one and no more than six <b>players</b>, inclusive. <em>(At its own discretion, each team may declare a <b>captain</b> prior to the start of any match. These rules never require a captain to serve in any unique or official role, and the declaration of a captain does not change which given answers the moderator must rule on as a bonus is being played. See Section E, "Bonuses".)</em>
<ol type="a">
	<li>An individual player may never be on the roster of more than one team at a single tournament. If multiple teams at a tournament represent the same school or institution, there can be no overlap in membership between any of those teams.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>An <b>active player</b> is a player who is able to give answers to questions within a match. Any/all players who are not active within an ongoing match are <b>non-active</b> [or <b>substituted out</b>; or <b>subbed out</b>]. In all respects other than the prospect of being substituted in (<em>See C.12</em>), a non-active player shall be treated the same as any other spectator.</li>
	<li>Each team may be accompanied by up to one <b>coach</b> during the match. Coaches may lodge protests at appropriate times (<em>See Section H, "Protests"</em>), may call for timeouts and/or substitutions at appropriate times, and may approach their players to speak to them at designated pauses in gameplay (<em>See Section C, "Match Execution"</em>). In all other respects, a coach shall be treated the same as any other spectator (<em>See I.2</em>). Together, the set of all players and coaches from both teams in a match constitute the <b>participant</b>s in that match.
<ol type="a">
	<li>No team may have more than one person serve officially as coach during any single match. If more than one person could conceivably serve as a team's official coach for the duration of the match (<em>for example, if one school brings multiple faculty members at the tournament and two or more of those faculty members are in the game room with a team from that school</em>), the moderator shall ask the players on that team to designate their official coach before the match begins.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The term <b>question</b> refers to either a tossup in its entirety or a bonus in its entirety (<em>i.e. a three-part bonus counts as a whole as one "question"</em>).
<ol type="a">
	<li>A <b>clue</b> is any standalone sentence within a question, or any clause or string of phrases which could be excerpted and read as though it were a standalone sentence referring to the desired answer; each question contains multiple clues referring to the desired answer(<em>s</em>). (<em>As such, it is never the case that a clue has been given if no main verb has yet been read</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>An <b>answer</b> is a verbal response given by a player, which can be ruled on to determine whether or not that player's team is to be awarded points and how the match is to proceed.</li>
	<li>The <b>packet</b> is the collection of questions from which a moderator reads in a particular match.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.8ajjnm6zfyc0">B. Equipment</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Each match shall be played using a <b>buzzer system</b> [or <b>lockout system</b>], an electronic device which allows any individual user to activate a signal (<em>such as a light accompanied by a sound</em>) and which locks out all other users from signaling once any one individual user has signaled.</li>
	<li>A single <b>button</b> [or buzzer <b>unit</b> or buzzer <b>module</b>] is the device which any individual player uses to give a signal, as a component connected to the overall lockout system. (<em>The button is the entire hand-held device, irrespective of its shape -- in a buzzer system where each player is handed a paddle which can be used to give a signal by clamping one's hand rather than pressing with one finger, the individual paddle is considered to be a "button".</em>) Each player in a match must be able to operate exactly one button which, when used, produces a unique signal (<em>typically a light and/or sound</em>) distinguishable from those of the other buttons in the buzzer system.</li>
	<li>An individual player <b>buzz</b>es in [or <b>buzzes</b>] by using their button to activate a signal (<em>such as the activation of a light accompanied by a sound</em>) which locks out all other users from signaling in the same way.</li>
	<li>The buzzer system may and must be <b>cleared</b> [or <b>reset</b>] by match officials at appropriate times. Clearing the buzzer system deactivates any previously-active signals displayed by the buzzer system and removes any electronic lockout affecting individual buttons.</li>
	<li>Before any match, each team may perform a <b>buzzer check</b> by ensuring that each player's button functions normally and that the system can be cleared. If either of the above conditions is not met and a spare buzzer system exists in the vicinity, the buzzer system shall be replaced with a spare as soon as possible, unless both teams agree to use the system in its partially-functional state.
<ol type="a">
	<li>In the event that all reasonable efforts to obtain a spare buzzer system have been exhausted and no spare buzzer system is available, both teams may agree to use a common verbal or physical sign as an equivalent to buzzing in (<em>e.g. saying "Buzz"; slapping the table</em>). In matches played without a buzzer system, all timing calls with regards to who buzzed in first are moderator judgments and are not protestable.</li>
	<li>In the event that all reasonable efforts to obtain a spare buzzer system have been exhausted and a partially-working buzzer system is available, the tournament director may authorize the use of the partially-working system.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Unless otherwise announced, the only materials which players are allowed to use during a match, besides the buzzer system, are writing implements and pieces of paper. Any piece of paper brought into a match must be completely blank except for rule lines and devoid of writing or erasure marks. Prepared notes or other study aids may not be brought to the area where active players are. (<em>This prohibition still applies during stoppages in gameplay such as at halftime or during time-outs.</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>A bound notebook may be brought into a match, provided that it is turned to a completely blank page before the match begins and that no other pages within the notebook are visible.</li>
	<li>Players may keep score on a pre-printed scoresheet, provided that any such scoresheet is otherwise devoid of additional writing, erasure marks, or modifications prior to the match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Players may not use any personal electronic devices (<em>including, but not limited to: cell phones, tablets, laptops, "wearable" tech devices</em>) during the duration of a match. This prohibition extends to any and all pauses in gameplay within a match.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The above rule does not apply to accommodations required by players due to a physical disability, such as hearing aids or electronic wheelchairs.</li>
	<li>Designated coaches may use an electronic device for the purpose of keeping score or taking notes during a match. Any electronic files used for this purpose must be reasonably blank (<em>e.g.: empty digital scoresheet, blank Word document</em>) before the match begins. Coaches who use an electronic device in this manner are obligated to keep all other programs and functions of the device closed or hidden as the match is in progress, and may not show any electronic scoresheet or notes to any player involved in the match except at halftime or during time-outs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Before the start of a match, all players, coaches, and spectators must ensure that electronic devices that may make noise or otherwise disrupt a match (<em>including, but not limited to: cell phones, tablets, laptops, watch alarms, "wearable" tech devices, cameras with flash</em>) are set to "silent" or turned off so that they cannot disrupt the match. The moderator may demand that any such device be removed from the game room if it is not properly deactivated in this manner.</li>
	<li>No person within a game room may make an audio or video recording of a match without the express permission of both teams, the moderator, and the tournament director.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.xanu3cj077at">C. Match Execution</h1>
<ol>
	<li>A <b>cycle</b> [or <b>tossup-bonus cycle</b>] consists of the reading of a single tossup question and any bonus question earned if a player duly gives a correct answer to that tossup question. (<em>See Section D, "Tossups," and Section E, "Bonuses".</em>)
<ol type="a">
	<li>The moderator should read the tossups designated for regulation play in the sequential order provided by the packet. In the event that the moderator skips over a tossup by accident, the moderator should go back and read the skipped-over tossup after the cycle in which the error is discovered. (<em>The cycles of the game can decouple from the numbering of tossups in the packet if this happens. For example, if the moderator skips the tossup numbered "2", but doesn't realize it until reading the tossup numbered "20," the moderator should then read the tossup number "2" to begin the twentieth cycle of the game</em>.)</li>
	<li>If a replacement question is needed, that replacement question is considered to be the single tossup or bonus in the cycle, rather than the question which was thrown out to necessitate the replacement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><b>Regulation play</b> consists of twenty cycles and any pauses taken between those cycles. A <b>match</b> consists of regulation play, followed by any pauses or tiebreaker questions required after the last cycle of regulation play.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If question supplies allow for it, the tournament director may permit each instance of regulation play across all matches of a tournament to consist of a number of cycles greater than twenty. At such a tournament, halftime (<em>See C.7</em>) takes place after the cycle whose number is half the total number, rounding up in the case of an odd number of cycles, rather than after the tenth cycle.</li>
	<li>If question supplies are limited such that it is not possible for regulation play in all matches across a tournament to consist of twenty cycles, the tournament director may permit designated <b>mini-match</b>es, in which regulation play consists of ten cycles. In a mini-match, there is no halftime, and substitutions may not be made at any point during regulation play. All points at which mini-matches will be in use must be announced by the tournament director before the tournament begins.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Each team may have no more than four active players competing in a match at any one time. If a team consists of four or more players, it must select four of those people as active players before the match begins. (<em>The starting lineup of active players need not be the same from match to match</em>.)</li>
	<li>After each cycle of a match, the moderator shall clear the buzzer system, such that no active players are locked out and all active players are able to buzz in on the upcoming tossup.</li>
	<li>After the last cycle of regulation play, the team with the higher score is declared the winner of the match.</li>
	<li>In the event of a tie in score after regulation play, the teams will play one or more additional (<em>sudden-death</em>) tossups until the first change in score occurs, at which point the team with the higher score is immediately declared the winner. (<em>Because the game ends immediately with the first change in score, answering a tiebreaker tossup correctly does not earn a player's team a bonus</em>.)</li>
	<li>After the tenth cycle of a match, the moderator must pause for <b>halftime</b>. Halftime shall last no longer than sixty seconds, unless more time is needed at the moderator's discretion to note the specifics of one or more protests (<em>See Section H, "Protests"</em>). At halftime, the moderator must perform a <b>score check</b> by announcing the official score, and reconciling discrepancies with players, coaches, or spectators who are keeping an unofficial score as needed.</li>
	<li>Each team may take up to one <b>timeout</b> per game. A team may only take their timeout by declaring verbally, between cycles, that they are taking their timeout for the game (<em>i.e. by saying "Timeout" or "Time"</em>). Timeouts shall last no longer than thirty seconds.
<ol type="a">
	<li>For each team, the moderator shall accept the first permissible call for a timeout which is directed at the moderator from any active player or coach on that team. Additional calls for a timeout beyond either team's first shall be ignored.</li>
	<li>Attempts to call for a timeout within a cycle (<em>i.e. while a tossup or bonus is being read; between a tossup and its corresponding bonus</em>) shall be ignored. Calls for a timeout while a tossup is being read shall be treated as conferring (<em>See D.11</em>).</li>
	<li>Except in cases of emergency, all players and coaches on both teams must remain within the game room during the duration of a timeout. If a participant does have to leave the game room for some genuine reason during a timeout and remains absent for more than thirty seconds, the moderator shall resume the match without the missing participant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The moderator will not pause the game at any point other than at halftime or during each team's designated timeout, except to accommodate emergencies or other reasonable requests at the moderator's discretion.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Each team may ask for a score check after any cycle of the game. Excessive requests for score checks may be interpreted as minor misconduct (<em>See Section I</em>) at the moderator's discretion if it interferes with the timely completion of the game.</li>
	<li>Each team may ask for a buzzer check after any cycle of the game. Excessive requests for buzzer checks may be interpreted as minor misconduct (<em>See Section I</em>) at the moderator's discretion if it interferes with the timely completion of the game.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>After the time allotted for halftime or any timeout expires, the moderator shall ask both teams if they are ready to continue before beginning the next cycle of the match.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If both teams indicate that they are ready to continue before the maximum allotted time for a pause in gameplay expires, the next cycle of the match shall begin as soon as the moderator is ready to resume reading.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>While a match is being played, active players on a team with a coach may only speak to their coach (<em>and vice versa</em>) during halftime, during timeouts taken by either team, or between regulation play and the reading of the first tiebreaker tossup in the event that both teams are tied in score after regulation play.</li>
	<li>Teams with more than four players on their roster may make <b>substitution</b>s at halftime, or after regulation play if and only if both teams are tied in score. <em>(Teams may NOT make substitutions at any other time, such as during their timeout, during the opposing team's timeout, at a mid-game buzzer check, or at any other point during the match.</em>) In order to make a substitution, a team must substitute in a non-active player for an active player, so that the previously non-active player becomes active and vice versa.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The moderator is expected to allow each team a chance to make substitutions at appropriate times. If the moderator fails to do so, either team may stop the moderator and make substitutions before the next tossup is read. If neither team stops the moderator before the moderator begins reading the next tossup after a substitution opportunity, the substitution opportunity ends even if the moderator failed to ask for them.</li>
	<li>A player who is substituted out at halftime may be substituted back in after regulation play in the event that both teams are tied in score after regulation play.</li>
	<li>If a team has fewer than four players active in a match already in progress, and a player on that team's roster arrives late to the game room, the newly-arrived player may begin playing in that match at the start of the next cycle; doing so is not counted as a substitution. If a team does start a game with four active players, then a late-arriving player must wait for a designated substitution opportunity before replacing any active player.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If and only if the moderator is reading a question or part which is an exact word-for-word repeat of a question or part the players have already heard over the course of the match or the tournament, any active player or coach may indicate to the moderator that the question is a repeat (<em>e.g. by saying "Repeat!"</em>), in which case the moderator will throw out the question in progress and read a replacement immediately. If an indication of exact repeat is lodged erroneously while the moderator is reading a tossup, the moderator may treat it as conferring (<em>See D.11</em>).
<ol type="a">
	<li>The moderator may throw out and immediately read a replacement for any question which is an exact word-for-word repeat of a question that has already been read out over the course of the match or the tournament in progress, even if no player has requested that the moderator do so.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>In the event that a replacement question of any kind needs to be read (<em>due to moderator error, protest, or any other reason</em>), each team involved must play the replacement question(s) with the same set of players who were active when the original, thrown-out question was read.</li>
	<li>In the event that a replacement tossup needs to be read, the replacement tossup should be drawn from any tossup(s) available in the packet after the last tossup designated for regulation play, in descending order, and then drawn from additional tossups provided by the tournament director if there are no extra tossups left to read in the packet. In the event that a replacement bonus needs to be read, the replacement bonus should be the next one in sequence within the packet, drawing from additional bonuses provided by the tournament director if there are no bonuses left to read in the packet. Teams may not object to the specific replacement question which gets read unless it is an exact repeat (<em>See C.13</em>). (<em>In particular, players have no basis for expecting that a replacement question be from the same category as a question which was thrown out, or for expecting that the match conform to a guaranteed "distribution" of categories after all necessary replacements are taken into account.</em>)</li>
	<li>The moderator must read the appropriate questions in the packet verbatim and may not provide teams any additional substantive information beyond the clues presented in questions while a tossup is live or a bonus is being played.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.i8skzw2aif49">D. Tossups</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unless otherwise stated, the value of giving the correct answer to a tossup question is 10 points.</li>
	<li>No player may give an answer to a tossup except for an active player who has buzzed in while the tossup is <b>live</b>. A tossup is live while it is being read and <em>(if applicable)</em> during the five seconds after the tossup has been read in full. If one team buzzes in and gives an incorrect answer after a tossup has already been read in full, that tossup shall remain live (<em>for the remaining team</em>) for exactly five seconds thereafter. (<em>A tossup "<b>goes dead"</b> if all opportunities to give answers to it expire and no players have given a correct answer</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>If a player who has not buzzed in attempts to give an answer to a tossup while it is live <em>(e.g. due to mistaking the signal corresponding to their button for another person's)</em>, the moderator shall treat it as conferring.</li>
	<li>If a player has buzzed in, and that player is the first player to buzz in while the ongoing tossup is live, and the moderator accidentally rules on the correctness of an answer given by any other player, the affected tossup will be thrown out; a replacement tossup will then be read immediately to all teams who were allowed to buzz in before the error was made.</li>
	<li>In the event that a tossup states that teams have a specified span of time longer than five seconds to buzz in after it has been read in full (<em>e.g. "You have 10 seconds,"</em>), it shall remain live for the amount of time it specifies in this way, both at first and again if one team gives an incorrect answer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>When a player who has buzzed in gives the correct answer to a tossup, the moderator shall state the number of points gained, and then read a bonus to that player's team. (<em>See Section E, "Bonuses"</em>.)</li>
	<li>Each team may only buzz in one time per tossup. If a player gives an incorrect answer to a tossup, all players on that player's team, including the person who gave the incorrect answer, are disallowed from buzzing in for the rest of the time in which that tossup is still live. (<em>Giving an incorrect answer to a tossup <b>locks out</b> the entire team</em>.) Any attempts by a team to buzz in beyond the first on a particular tossup shall be ignored and cleared from the buzzer system.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If a player gives an incorrect answer to a tossup before it has been read in full, the moderator shall continue reading the rest of the tossup to the team which is still allowed to buzz in.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>When a player buzzes in, the moderator must stop reading the tossup immediately and <b>recognize</b> that player, which can be done verbally (<em>e.g. by saying the player's name or saying "Yes" to them</em>) or by a gesture such as pointing to, making eye contact with, or nodding at that player. A player who has buzzed in need not wait to be recognized in this manner before giving their answer to the tossup.</li>
	<li>From the moment at which a player buzzers in, that player has five seconds in which to give an answer. (<em>Recognition exists entirely as a courtesy to the player; the amount of time it takes to recognize the player who buzzed in has no effect on this count</em>.) After five seconds, the moderator shall call time (<em>i.e. by saying "Time"</em>). Any answer given after the moderator calls "Time" will not be considered.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The calling of time is a matter of moderator judgment and is not protestable.</li>
	<li>If a player gives an answer at the same time that the moderator calls time, the tie is resolved in favor of the player.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The first team to interrupt the reading of a tossup by buzzing in with an incorrect answer shall have 5 points deducted from its score. (<em>This penalty is known as a <b>neg</b> or a <b>neg-5</b></em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>If the second team also interrupts the reading of the same tossup by buzzing in with an incorrect answer, no points shall be deducted from its score.</li>
	<li>No points shall be deducted from the score of any team that buzzes in with an incorrect answer after a tossup has been read in full.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If a live tossup has been read in full, and five seconds have elapsed in which no player has buzzed in (<em>i.e. At the moment a tossup goes dead</em>), the moderator shall call time. Any attempts to buzz in after the moderator calls "Time" will not be considered.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If a player buzzes in at the same time that the moderator calls time, the tie is resolved in favor of the player.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If all opportunities to buzz in on a tossup have expired and neither team has given the correct answer, or both teams have buzzed in with neither team having given the correct answer, the moderator shall stop reading the current tossup, reveal the correct answer to it, and then continue the match as appropriate (<em>See Section C, "Match Execution"</em>).</li>
	<li>While a tossup is live, the moderator may not ask any players or teams to give an answer, or provide any verbal warning that time is about to expire, while a tossup is live.</li>
	<li><b>Conferring</b> is not allowed while a tossup is live. Conferring consists of any verbal, written, signed, or analogous linguistic communication by any active player which could convey information pertinent to the possible answer of a question. Any instances of conferring while a tossup is live will be treated as giving an incorrect answer, will result in the same point deduction or lack thereof as giving an incorrect answer (<em>i.e. will result in a neg for the first team to confer if conferring interrupts the reading of a tossup</em>), and will disallow the team that conferred from buzzing in for the rest of the time in which that tossup is still live. Non-substantive gestures or exclamations, which include waving one's hands, raising or lowering one's button, uttering brief interjections of surprise, etc., do not count as conferring and need not be penalized or acknowledged by the moderator unless they otherwise qualify as misconduct (<em>See Section I, "Ethics and Conduct"</em>).
<ol type="a">
	<li>As soon the moderator discovers an instance of conferring on a tossup, the moderator shall declare to both teams that it has occurred (<em>e.g. by saying "Illegal conferring"</em>) and proceed as though the conferring team has given an incorrect answer. In the event that a team engages in conferring and the moderator has not discovered it, any active player or coach on the other team may directly address the moderator briefly to note the problem (<em>e.g. by saying "They're conferring"</em>) without being penalized themselves.</li>
	<li>In the event that the tossup is still live after an instance of conferring on a tossup, the remaining team may buzz in and give an answer as normal, and may take the other team's utterances into account.</li>
	<li>If the buzzer system is not cleared while a tossup is live, any active player or coach may request that the moderator clear the buzzer system (<em>e.g.: by saying "Clear, please" or "Reset!"</em>). Requests to the moderator to clear the buzzer do not constitute conferring.</li>
	<li>The brief indication of intent to protest (<em>i.e. saying "Protest" directly to the moderator</em>) does not constitute conferring.</li>
	<li>The raising of a procedural complaint (<em>See I.6.b</em>) does not constitute conferring.</li>
	<li>If a player believes that their button or the buzzer system is malfunctioning, that player may say "Buzz" instead of buzzing in; saying "Buzz" in this manner shall be treated the same as buzzing in with the electronic buzzer system and does not constitute conferring. The decision of a moderator that this has occurred before or after another player buzzes in with the electronic buzzer system is a judgment call and is not protestable.</li>
	<li>Moderator judgment as to whether conferring occurred is not protestable.</li>
	<li>Irrespective of which button is held or used by which player, the player who buzzes in is the one who gets to give an answer. Attempting to "buzz in for" a teammate, such that one player buzzes in and a second player gives the answer, counts as conferring if the player who buzzes in and the player who gives the answer are not the same player. (<em>See D.2.a.</em>)</li>
	<li>If an instance of conferring involves two or more players on the same team, and individual player totals are being tallied as part of the official score, the penalty shall be assessed on the first player to speak as part of that instance of conferring, or, if multiple players spoke simultaneously, to exactly one of those players at the moderator's discretion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the moderator has begun reading a tossup and has not yet read a verb, or a proper noun, or a word within quotation marks, or a noun or adjective which is a technical term in an academic field, (<em>e.g. "Next tossup. One of..."</em>), a player who buzzes in may claim to have to have buzzed in accidentally. In such a case, the moderator may rule it an <b>accidental</b> buzz [or <b>stray</b> buzz] and proceed as though the player had not buzzed in. The moderator cannot rule any buzz accidental if any one word of the types listed above has already been read.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Whether or not a term is "technical" is a matter of moderator discretion and is not protestable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>In the event that a malfunction in the buzzer system is discovered during a match (<em>i.e. it automatically makes a signal for a player who has not buzzed in, a unit fails to buzz in sometimes, etc.</em>), either team may request that the tossup from the ongoing cycle (<em>or the tossup from the most recently-concluded cycle, should the malfunction be discovered between cycles</em>) be thrown out and replaced. In the event that such a replacement takes place, no questions other than the original tossup read during the ongoing cycle may be replaced or replayed.</li>
	<li>In the event that the moderator accidentally reveals the answer to a tossup while the tossup is still live, the tossup will be thrown out; a replacement tossup will then be read immediately to all teams who were allowed to buzz in before the error was made. (<em>See C.15 for details on where replacement questions are drawn from</em>.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h.u3qdatt0x9mp">DX. Optional addendum: Power marks</h2>
(<em>Official ACF tournaments do not use power marks. However, some collegiate tournaments use them. This optional addendum is included so that non-ACF tournaments have consistent rules to look to in their usage of power marks.</em>)
<ol>
	<li>Tossups may include a <b>power mark</b>, a non-verbal symbol placed at some point within their question text. (<em>In most cases, this mark will be an asterisk surrounded by parentheses, e.g.: </em>'(*)', <em>and the text before the power mark will be bolded as an additional visual aid to the moderator. In some cases, there is no explicit power mark printed, but the space between the last word of bolded text and the first word of regular text serves the same purpose</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>While reading a tossup with a power mark, the moderator shall not outwardly indicate the location of the power mark in any manner, and should read the text on either side of the power mark without interruption. Players should not know where the mark is located within the question text while a tossup is live.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The point value of buzzing in and giving the correct answer of a tossup before or at the moment the moderator has read up to the power mark is 15 points. (<em>The act of buzzing in and giving a correct answer in this way is known as getting a <b>power</b>.</em>)
<ol type="a">
	<li>"Up to the power mark" includes any point at which the moderator is in the process of reading, but has not yet finished reading, the syllable of text immediately after the power mark.</li>
	<li>Whether or not a player buzzed before, at, or within less than a syllable after the power mark is a matter of moderator judgment, and is not protestable.</li>
	<li>During any score check, players may ask the moderator to reveal the location of the power mark(s) in any tossup the player has heard during the match thus far, so as to ensure that score was kept accurately during the match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The lack of a power mark within the question text of a tossup is not protestable. (<em>If a tossup has no power mark, it has the same point value at all points where a player could buzz in. The moderator cannot "make up" a point where the power mark "would" be.</em>)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.8bwh50kvbpas">E. Bonuses</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Each bonus question consists of multiple bonus <b>part</b>s. The total value of all parts within a bonus always adds up to 30 points. (<em>In virtually all cases</em><em>, a bonus will consist of three parts worth 10 points each</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>If the total value of all parts within a bonus is found to equal a number other than 30 points, either team may ask for the bonus to be thrown out and replaced immediately.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The moderator shall read one bonus part individually, and preside over timing, rule on given answers, etc. for that bonus part, before moving onto the next. The team which earned the bonus [the <b>controlling team</b>] shall have five seconds after each bonus part has been read in full to give an answer for that part, unless a different amount of time is specified by the question text. The team which did not earn the bonus [the <b>non-controlling team</b>] does not have any opportunity to give answers.
<ol type="a">
	<li>In the event that a bonus part specifies a longer amount of time in which to give an answer (<em>e.g. "You have 10 seconds"</em>), each opportunity to give an answer to that bonus part shall last as long as the bonus part specifies rather than the default five seconds.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>For as long as a team has the opportunity to give answers to a bonus part, conferring is allowed for all active players on that team.</li>
	<li>A team's official answer on any bonus part is the first answer which any member of that team directs toward the moderator.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If a team directs an answer toward the moderator while the moderator is still reading a bonus part, the moderator shall stop reading immediately and rule on the correctness of that given answer.</li>
	<li>If two or more players on the same team give distinct answers to the same bonus part by directing them toward the moderator simultaneously, the moderator will ask the team to select one from among that set of answers as their official answer. The team must then select one answer immediately, or else be ruled incorrect. Moderator judgment as to what counts as simultaneous is not protestable. Any attempt to amend the team's answer to a new one outside the set of initial simultaneously-directed answers will automatically be ruled incorrect. (<em>See Section F, "Ruling on Answers".</em>)</li>
	<li>It is never necessary to "defer" to or "designate" before any player begins directing an answer. (<em>There is no mandated role for a "captain" in selecting a team's official answer</em>.)</li>
	<li>While a bonus is being played, the standalone words "Defer" or "Designate," and simple sentences using those words as their main verb (<em>e.g. "I designate Paul"</em>), shall be ignored and shall not be treated as a team's official answer even if directed toward the moderator. The only instance in which the above does not apply is in situations where it is reasonable for the word "defer" or "designate," or a word form thereof, to be the first word of the correct answer to the bonus part, in which case it becomes a matter of moderator judgment whether to accept that word as the team's answer; such judgments are not protestable. A team will never gain any additional time to give an answer to a bonus part by saying "Defer" or "Designate."</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If no team member directs an answer toward the moderator within four seconds, the moderator <u>must</u> ask the team for an official answer (<em>e.g. by saying "Answer?"</em>). The team has one second thereafter to provide an answer, after which point the moderator shall call time. (<em>This is UNLIKE a player's opportunity to give an answer to a tossup, during which the moderator may NOT say anything special at the four-second mark. See D</em><em>.10</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>If a player gives an answer at the same time that the moderator calls time, the tie is resolved in favor of the player.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>In the event that no correct answer is given, the moderator shall reveal the answer to each bonus part immediately after the last opportunity to give an answer for that bonus part expires.</li>
	<li>At the end of the bonus, the moderator should clearly state the total number(s) of points gained and immediately reconcile any discrepancies over the point total.</li>
	<li>Bonuses are not tied to or related to specific tossups. The moderator should always read the next available bonus in the packet each time a new bonus needs to be read. (<em>For example: If the moderator is reading a packet of questions in which Tossups 1, 2, and 3 all go dead, but Tossup 4 is answered correctly, the moderator SHOULD read Bonus 1 to the team which earned it, and SHOULD NOT skip to Bonus 4</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>In the event that the moderator skips over a bonus by accident, the moderator should go back and read the skipped-over bonus at the next opportunity in which a bonus needs to be read, then continue thereafter with the sequential order of bonuses presented by the packet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>In the event that the moderator accidentally reveals the answer to a bonus part before a team has its duly-permitted opportunity to answer, the scorekeeper shall note the issue and the match will continue. If it is true after regulation play that the points thus removed could affect the win-loss outcome of the match, then a replacement bonus will be read after regulation play.</li>
	<li>In all situations in which a bonus must be replaced, a new bonus will be read to the same controlling team, on which it shall not be possible to gain more points than the potential maximum if the error had not occurred, and it shall not be possible to gain fewer points than the total gained from the original bonus with error included. (<em>For example, consider an original bonus with three parts worth 10 points each, on which the controlling team gives an incorrect answer to the first part, gives a correct answer to the second part, and cannot give an answer to the third part due to moderator error, with no other factors involved. On the replacement bonus, that team can score no fewer than 10 points and no more than 20. Even if they give incorrect answers for all three parts of the replacement bonus, they will gain 10 points, because they already answered one part of the original bonus correctly and are not penalized out of those points by the moderator's error. Even if they give correct answers to all parts of the replacement bonus, they will gain 20 points, because they gave an incorrect answer to one part of the original bonus and do not get second chance at lost scoring opportunities unaffected by the moderator's error.</em>)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Before reading a replacement bonus, the moderator should state the range(s) of point values available and ensure that both teams understand the situation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.p7cyzatwcqjn">F. Ruling on Answers</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Whenever a player directs a given answer at the moderator, the moderator shall <b>rule on</b> the correctness of that answer by determining whether it is correct [and thereby <b>accept</b>ing it] or incorrect. Each tossup, and each bonus part, will specify a list of possible correct [or <b>acceptable</b>; or <b>desired</b>] answers, and sometimes further instructions regarding related answers or similar possible answers or specific unacceptable answers, on an <b>answer line</b> immediately following the text of the question itself. In general, except in cases of immediately obvious factual errors or printing errors or omissions on the answer line, the moderator is to follow its instructions, as well as the Specific Correctness Guidelines below (<em>See Section G</em>). (<em>Moderators without particular subject-matter expertise are encouraged to trust that teams will protest if a factual issue beyond the moderator's understanding is at issue, rather than attempt to resolve it before any team indicates intent to lodge a protest. See Section H, "Protests".</em>)</li>
	<li>When a player or team has the opportunity to give an answer, the first given answer which the moderator recognizes is the only answer that will be ruled on. Giving an answer involves completing at least one word that could uniquely identify a potential answer and then, if applicable, completing all other words of that potential answer without any unnatural pauses or pauses of longer than a second between words within that potential answer (<em>disregarding embellishing; See F.8</em>). A player who wishes to amend their given answer (<em>e.g. to correct the pronunciation of a word, to change from one given answer to another</em>) must do so, without any unnatural pause, before the moderator has ruled on any answer that player has given.</li>
	<li>In the event that an active player gives an answer to any kind of question and that given answer is ruled incorrect, the moderator shall note verbally that the given answer was incorrect without indicating any reason for that ruling while the question is still live. (<em>E.g.: It is not permitted to say "I can't accept that pronunciation," "You changed your answer three words in," "so close," etc</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>In exception to the above, the moderator must expressly indicate when time is called and/or when a team engages in disallowed conferring. (<em>Moderators should take care not to reveal whether instances of conferring included part or all of a correct answer.</em>)</li>
	<li>If the moderator reveals the reason for ruling a given answer incorrect on a tossup and the opposing team still has a chance to answer that tossup, the team which buzzed in with the incorrect answer may request that the a replacement question be read for the opposing team only instead of the rest of the original tossup.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If a player gives an answer which is not outright incorrect, but is nonetheless not specific enough to precisely identify the answer, the moderator must <b>prompt</b>, asking the player for a more specific answer (<em>e.g. "I need more," "More specific, please", "More," or simply "Prompt"</em>), rather than ruling on it outright. A player (<em>on a tossup</em>) or team (<em>on a bonus part</em>) has three seconds to give a more specific answer after being prompted. If the player or team responds by giving with a more specific answer which is still not as specific as is required, the moderator shall prompt again, allowing two more seconds for a still-more-specific answer, and will continue to do so an indefinite number of times so long as the given answers continue to have greater specificity in the direction of a/the desired answer to the question.
<ol type="a">
	<li>While a bonus part is being played, the team that was prompted may confer as normal during their three seconds after being prompted. While a tossup is being played, conferring is not allowed even if the player who buzzed in has been prompted.</li>
	<li>The moderator will not ask again for an answer (<em>i.e. may not say "Answer please," etc</em>.) during the three seconds following a prompt, regardless of whether the prompt occurs on a tossup or bonus.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Some questions may have answer line instructions to the moderator to <b>anti-prompt</b>, asking the player for a less specific answer. (<em>e.g. "Less specific," or simply "anti-prompt"</em>). All rules regarding timing, conferring, etc. for anti-prompts are the same as those regarding prompts.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The moderator may <u>never</u> anti-prompt unless instructions on an answer line explicitly mandate doing so for the particular answer a player gave. Teams may nonetheless receive repeated anti-prompt instructions if their response upon being anti-prompted for one answer is to give another answer for which there are instructions to anti-prompt.</li>
	<li>If a player or team is anti-prompted and then responds with an answer which is even less specific than a/the desired answer to the question (<em>i.e. goes from an over-specific given answer to an under-specific given answer</em>), the moderator may (<em>issue a "normal"</em>) prompt.</li>
	<li>The fact that a player was not anti-prompted for giving an inexact answer is not protestable. The absence of instructions to anti-prompt on an answer line is not protestable.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The moderator may ask for a player to repeat a given answer before ruling on it if it was not possible to hear it clearly. If this occurs, the player may not change their answer in any way. Attempting to take advantage of a moderator by changing to a different given answer when asked to repeat an already-given answer is a form of misconduct (<em>See Section I</em>).</li>
	<li>The moderator may ask for the player to spell their given answer before ruling on it if it would help the moderator distinguish the player's answer from other similar possible answers. If a player is asked to spell their answer, only letters which are essential for distinguishing the player's intended answer need to be correct. (<em>For example: A player who gives the answer "Monet" may be asked to spell it out so as to distinguish given answers indicating Claude Monet from possible </em><em>answers indicating Edouard Manet. A player who spells out "M-O-N-A-Y", or who says "with an O", has succeeded at that task and will be ruled correct, without spelling skill or lack thereof affecting the correctness of the answer</em>.)</li>
	<li>Embellishment of given answers will be disregarded unless it renders the given answer incorrect. Hesitation markers around given answers (<em>e.g. "Uh....uh...Descartes"</em>,) and/or the embedding of a given answer in a larger sentence (<em>e.g. "this has to be the awesomely-named bomb calorimeter,"</em><em> "Who is Bram Stoker?"</em>) will never in and of themselves render an answer incorrect. In any case, the player must give the first actual word of a potential answer before time is called, and does not gain extra time by saying filler words. If a player embellishes their given answer, the determination as to which word is the first word of a potential answer is a matter of moderator judgment and is not protestable.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Phrases directed at the moderator which consist only of a negation of one possible answer will be ruled on as though the player directed that possible answer without the negation. (<em>e.g. If a player directs the given answer "It's not Chaucer..." </em><em>to the moderator, without saying any more, the moderator should rule on the given answer "Chaucer," including accepting it if "Chaucer" is an acceptable answer</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>A player may give an answer which contains two or more pieces of related information of different types (<em>such as both the title of a work and its creator</em>), to be treated as a unified answer. If any one piece of information given in this way contains the answer being sought, and all such pieces of information are correctly and clearly related to one another in a factually accurate manner, the answer shall be ruled correct. (<em>For example, "Homer's The Odyssey" is an acceptable answer if the answer being sought is either "The Odyssey" or "Homer" and the question has been describing the Odyssey as "this work"</em><em>; "Aesop's The Odyssey" is not an acceptable answer for any question, as authorship of The Odyssey is not attributed to Aesop. Players are strongly discouraged from merely listing related pieces of information, and should try to produce all information in a unified grammatical phrase whenever possible</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>When giving an answer to a tossup, any answer containing two or more pieces of related information must be applicable as of the clue on which the player buzzed in.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If multiple answers are required (<em>e.g. a bonus part which asks players to "Name the two countries" which engaged in a particular war</em>), all given answers except the last one must be completed and directed toward the moderator before time is called, and the last given answer must be started before time is called; any answers given thereafter will be disregarded. Players will not be prompted for giving a list of answers which is shorter than the required number.</li>
	<li>Players are not expected to know the exact pronunciation of every answer. Any reasonable attempt at pronouncing the answer being sought with the proper consonants in the proper order will be ruled correct, unless one or more vowels must be uniquely specified to distinguish the player's given answer from other possible given answers, in which case (<em>e.g. the "Manet" vs. "Monet" example presented in the reminder text of F.7</em>), only the distinguishing vowel(s) need be correct. A player's given answer must not add any consonants which would not be visible while reading the answer in text form, and must not switch the order of any consonants. (<em>For example, "Stend-HALE" or "STOON-dahl" are acceptable pronunciations if the desired answer is Stendhal, but "STED-nahl" or "STINK-dahl" are not</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>The syllable on which stress is placed in a player's answer will never in itself cause the answer to be ruled incorrect (<em>even if the answer being sought has an accent mark specifying where the proper stress occurs</em>).</li>
	<li>Players need not account for accent marks or diacritical marks in attempting a reasonable pronunciation of their given answers.</li>
	<li>Moderators should make efforts to accommodate players with speech impediments or heavy accents, so that the intended pronunciation (<em>or failing that, spelling</em>) of each player's answer is not in doubt.</li>
	<li>If a consonant could be reasonably read to be silent, a player's answer will not be ruled incorrect for having left that consonant silent. (<em>E.g.: A player will not be ruled incorrect for saying "mah-NEY" instead of "mah-NET" if the desired answer is Manet</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.zgw20vfail18">G. Detailed Correctness Guidelines</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unless specified below as optional or "at the discretion of the answer line," these guidelines may be used to overrule or add to the printed substance of an answer line within a packet in the event of moderator judgment of how to rule on an answer or tournament director judgment about how to resolve a protest.</li>
	<li>In cases where the correct answer to a question has an original name not in the English language, the original-language name is also acceptable, as are all common published English names and literal English translations of those names.(<em>E.g.: For Marcel Proust’s series "À la recherche du temps perdu," that original French title is acceptable, the literal translation "In Search of Lost Time" is acceptable, and the title "Remembrance of Things Past" is acceptable because the series was published under that name in English; however, "En búsqueda del tiempo perdido" is not acceptable, since Spanish is not the original language of the series</em>.) Ambiguities across languages are resolved in favor of the player.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Ambiguities across languages as to the accuracy of a plausible translation will normally be resolved in favor of the player. Implausible or inaccurate translations are not acceptable. (<em>For example, "A Dog’s Heart," "Heart of a Dog," "The Heart of a Dog," and "The Heart of the Dog" are all acceptable answers for the short story by Mikhail Bulgakov whose original Russian name is "Sobace serdtse," as the player is not expected to figure out whether or how to supply articles that do not exist in Russian. "The Heart Inside the Dog" is never acceptable, since there is no correct way to translate the Russian title in that way. Since moderators and tournament directors cannot be expected to be familiar with every foreign language, players are encouraged to give non-esoteric or traditional English translations, or the original-language title, whenever possible.</em>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the desired answer to a question is a real, non-fictional person with a known family name, the player must typically give the family name of that real person to be ruled correct. Other names of that person may be provided in any order (<em>e.g.: "Proust, Marcel" and "Marcel Proust" are equally acceptable given answers</em>). This rule applies irrespective of the proper ordering of names in the language or naming convention that the real person originates from. (<em>For example, modern Chinese naming conventions place the family name first. The burden is on the player to know which name is the family name and which is the individual's given name; given names alone are never acceptable answers for a real person</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>In exception to the above rule, when the answer is a ruler within a series in which each person has a regnal name and/or number, the player need only give the regnal name and number (<em>if there is a number</em>) of that ruler, without specifying a family name or dynastic house name. (<em>E</em><em>.g. "Pope Francis" is an acceptable answer for the pope who was elected in 2013, and "John" [without specifying number or family name] is an acceptable answer for the king of England who agreed to the Magna Carta, as there has only been one King John of England. "Henry VIII" [without specifying Tudor as the family name] is an acceptable answer for the king of England who died in 1547; saying just "Henry" is sufficient for a prompt but is not acceptable outright, as it does not uniquely identify any of the eight people named Henry who held the English monarchy.</em>)</li>
	<li>If a person's family name combines two names using a hyphen (<em>e.g. "Levi-Strauss"</em>), the names on either side of the hyphen must be given in the proper order for the given answer to be acceptable, and neither name on either side of the answer may be prompted on. If a person's family name combines two words without a hyphen all such words must be given in the proper order for the given answer to be acceptable, unless otherwise specified below or by the answer line (<em>e.g. "George" is not acceptable if the sought-after surname is "Lloyd George"</em>). If a person's family name contains one or more nobiliary particles at the beginning (<em>e.g. the "van" in "van Buren," the "de" in "de Cervantes"</em>), players need only give those particles which are necessary for specifying the surname within English-language common usage. (<em>e.g. "Buren" is not an acceptable given answer for the historical person Martin van Buren, but "Cervantes" is an acceptable given answer for the historical person Don Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</em>.)</li>
	<li>For lengthy Spanish-language surnames, the family name inherited from the person's father is generally a sufficient acceptable answer if given alone. In exception to the above, "Picasso" alone is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Pablo Ruiz y Picasso; "Marquez" is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Gabriel Garcia Marquez; and "Lorca" is always required and sufficient if the full desired answer is Federico Garcia Lorca.</li>
	<li>If a person's family name changed over the course of his or her life (<em>e.g. by marrying into a different family</em>), any family name which that person had over the course of life is equally acceptable. If a person changed both given name(s) and family name(s) at once, given names and family names may not be mixed and matched across the name change. (<em>E.g. "Leslie Lynch Ford" is not an acceptable answer for the person who was born Leslie Lynch King and later changed his name to Gerald Ford.</em>)</li>
	<li>If a single person is commonly known by a pseudonym or pen name which corresponds uniquely to that person, that pseudonym is acceptable in place of the person's family name. (<em>For example: "Mary Ann Evans" and "George Eliot" are always both acceptable ways for the player to give an answer to a question whose desired answer is the author of Middlemarch</em>.) If multiple people share a pseudonym in a shared context, and the desired answer is the pseudonym, none of the individual users of that pseudonym is an acceptable answer in its own right. (&lt;F<em>or example, the answer "Alexander Hamilton" is not acceptable if a question asks for the shared pseudonym of the authors of the Federalist Papers.</em>)</li>
	<li>If two or more people from the same era or family share a surname, or if two people from the same general context or category share a surname, an answer line may dictate that the player give more than just the last name to uniquely identify the desired person. The choice of whether or not to require additional information in this way is at the discretion of the answer line. (<em>E.g: This may occur to distinguish the answer lines "ANSWER: <u><b>M</b></u>ary Godwin <b><u>Shelley</u></b>" and "ANSWER: <b><u>P</u></b>ercy Bysshe <b><u>Shelley</u></b>".</em>)</li>
	<li>If two or more people from the same family share both their given name and their surname, and each could be a plausible given answer, the player's given answer must unambiguously refer to one of those people by some means which rules out the other. (<em>For example, by using "the Elder" or "the Younger," or by giving a middle name or nickname which the two people do not share.</em>) The choice of whether to require "Junior" or "Senior" is at the discretion of the answer line.</li>
	<li>The only acceptable answer for the second president of the United States is "John Adams." Given answers referring to the sixth president of the United States, John Quincy Adams, must include reference to his middle name (<em>'Q' is sufficient for this purpose</em>); "John Adams" is always an outright unacceptable answer if the full desired answer is "John Quincy Adams".</li>
	<li>In cases where a person came from an era or society in which surnames did/do not exist as they do in contemporary standard form, reasonably common identifications of a person by given name are acceptable. This includes situations where the only surname is one identifying a person by place of origin (<em>e.g. "Leonardo" is acceptable for "Leonardo da Vinci"</em>).</li>
	<li>Other cases where a person's work or accomplishments result in their being typically referred to by a distinctive, uncommon given name alone (<em>e.g. "Oprah" for "Oprah Winfrey", "Rembrandt" for "Rembrandt van Rijn"</em>), or cases in which a very common way of referring uniquely to a person deviates from the guidelines above, are at the discretion of the answer line.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Acceptable answers for fictional characters include the character's personal or first name, family name, and/or commonly-used nickname(s) appearing in the work(s) containing that character, as long as such information is sufficient to uniquely identify the character within that character's fictional universe.</li>
	<li>If the correct answer to a question is a religious or mythical figure appearing in multiple religious or mythological traditions, acceptable answers are limited to the names of that figure in specific traditions which have been identified, either explicitly or by reference to character names found only within those traditions, in the question text up to the point at which the player buzzed in. (<em>This generalizes, and includes, the situation of deities who have different names in Greek and Roman mythology. </em><em>For example: "Zeus" is not acceptable if a question's desired answer is "Jupiter" and it uses clues found only in Roman mythology and ritual</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>In exception to the above, the names of characters presented in common English-language translations of the Bible are always acceptable for those characters. (<em>For example, players need not give the Quranic or Arabic version of names when a question uses clues only from Islamic tradition about a character who is also found in the Bible</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Unless the player states otherwise, all dates in answers given by the player are assumed to be from the years AD/CE on the Gregorian calendar. If a player's answer contains a year within the past one hundred calendar years, inclusive of the year in which the match is being played, it is only necessary to give the final two digits of that year; otherwise, all digits are required. (<em>For example: "63" is an acceptable answer if the desired correct answer is "1963", but it is not an acceptable answer if the desired correct answer is "1763".</em>)</li>
	<li>In cases where the desired correct answer to a question is the title of a work, the player must generally give the full title of the work for their given answer to be acceptable. The moderator is never allowed to prompt if the player gives only part of a title.
<ol type="a">
	<li>In exception to the above, when giving an answer which is a title, players may omit the leading article "The," "An," or "A" from a title which has any single one of those articles as its first word (<em>e.g.: "Red Badge of Courage" is as acceptable as "The Red Badge of Courage"</em>).</li>
	<li>Players may not add a leading article where a title has none, or supply an incorrect leading article, or else the entire given answer becomes unacceptable. If pronunciation leaves it ambiguous whether a player is adding the article "A" or merely embellishing (<em>"uh..."</em><em>, See Section F.8</em>), the moderator should assume that the player is embellishing rather than adding a leading article.</li>
	<li>In cases where a work is commonly published under an abbreviated title, the abbreviated title under which it is published is acceptable in place of the full title. (<em>E.g.: The answer "The Wealth of Nations" is as acceptable as "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations."</em>)</li>
	<li>Players are never required to give the subtitle(s) of a work if the desired answer is a title. A subtitle on its own is never an acceptable answer to give in place of the title. (<em>e.g.: "What You Will" is never an acceptable answer for the Shakespeare play "Twelfth Night: Or, What You Will"</em>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the desired answer is a person or an organization which has a known acronym or abbreviation in common usage (<em>e.g.: "LBJ" for Lyndon Baines Johnson, "HHS" for the Department of Health and Human Services</em>), the acronym is acceptable. Contrived or rare acronyms (<em>e.g.: "GWB" for George Walker Bush</em>) are not acceptable. If an acronym or abbreviation could refer to two plausible organizations (<em>e.g. "NRA" for National Rifle Association or National Recovery Association</em>) , it is at the discretion of the answer line whether to prompt on, outright accept, or outright not accept the shared acronym.</li>
	<li>Unless an answer line permits otherwise, the chemical symbol is never acceptable when the desired answer is a chemical element. If the desired answer is a specific molecule or chemical compound, IUPAC names and common names are typically both acceptable; the chemical formula for a compound is only an acceptable answer if the formula uniquely identifies that one compound and reciting the formula in full would not constitute unsportsmanlike delay of game or any other kind of misconduct.</li>
	<li>Unless an answer line permits otherwise, a symbol representing a physical or mathematical quantity is not acceptable in place of the common-usage verbal name of that quantity, unless the predominantly common way of naming that quantity is by speaking the name of its symbol aloud. (<em>E.g.: "U" is usually not an acceptable answer in place of "potential energy," but "e" is usually an acceptable answer in place of "Euler's number"</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Unless an answer line permits otherwise, the letter abbreviations for nucleotides and nucleobases, the three-letter abbreviations for amino acids, and the codon or anticodon sequences corresponding to an amino acid are not acceptable answers in place of the common names for those types of biochemical objects.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the desired answer is a musical note or key from a specific piece of music or musical context, the player's given answer must match that note or key "as written" even if other possible answers are enharmonically or technically equivalent. (<em>For example, if a question asks the player to give the answer "E-flat" in describing the key of a symphony, "D-sharp" is not acceptable, even though D-sharp and E-flat represent the same pitch class in different contexts</em>.)</li>
	<li>If the desired answer is a state, province, country, or school, there is no need to embellish beyond the common proper name of the place, except in cases where an unmodified place name is not uniquely identifying. (<em>For example, it is never necessary to give "Harvard University" or "Republic of Zimbabwe" as one's answer, rather than just "Harvard" or "Zimbabwe," respectively, but one must specify "Boston University" or "Boston College" rather than just "Boston" to identify either of those two schools, as they are distinct entities.</em>.)
<ol type="a">
	<li>In cases where a player gives the unmodified answer "China," it is assumed that the player is referring to the government or country whose territory is in mainland China, and not solely to the island of Taiwan or the government based in Taiwan.</li>
	<li>Unless question text specifically requires or requests them, postal abbreviations, national aircraft registration prefixes, etc. are not acceptable answers in place of the common name of a state, province, or country.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>For questions where the desired answer is a place, the correctness of various historical names for that place is determined by whether a clue in the question has specified the era in which that historical place name was current, up to the point at which the player buzzed in. If no clue can be used to specify a past time period and all clues are in present tense, it is assumed by default that only place names used in the present day are acceptable. (<em>For example: "Rhodesia" is not an acceptable answer for a question on the contemporary nation of Zimbabwe if all clues given refer to Zimbabwe.</em>)
<ol type="a">
	<li>Unless the answer line permits otherwise, "Russia" is not an acceptable answer to a question if all clues which have been read refer to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics between 1917 and 1991.</li>
	<li>Unless the answer line permits otherwise, "England" is not an acceptable answer to a question if all clues which have been read refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain from 1707 to the present.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>For United States appellate (<em>including Supreme Court</em>) cases, either party name is acceptable alone unless exactly one party is "United States" or a particular state, county, city, jurisdiction, etc., in which case the other party name must be given. (<em>E.g.: either "Gibbons" or "Ogden" is sufficient to identify the case Gibbons v. Ogden, but "Miranda" is required for Miranda v. Arizona, and an answer of "Arizona" will not be accepted or prompted for any case in which the state of Arizona is a party</em><em>.</em>) When giving the full name of the case, any order of party names is acceptable (<em>e.g.: "Gibbons v. Ogden" is just as acceptable as "Ogden v. Gibbons"</em>). Widely known informal nicknames for specific court cases (<em>such as "the Sick Chicken Case"</em>) are acceptable answers unless the answer line indicates otherwise. Docketing numbers are never acceptable.</li>
	<li>If the correct answer for a given question has an answer which is a common number or derived mathematical formula, and the player's given answer expresses the desired number or formula without specifying units, the moderator will assume the player's answer is in the proper units. If the player &lt;does give an answer specifying the units, the unit specified must be correct. (&lt;e<em>.g: If the full desired answer is "2 meters per second," the player may give "2" as an acceptable answer, but "2 miles per hour" is not acceptable.</em>) Answers which require converting the desired numerical answer into other unit systems (<em>e.g. giving the proper conversion of a meters-per-second answer into the equivalent amount in miles per hour</em>) are not acceptable unless expressly permitted by an answer line.
<ol type="a">
	<li>If the correct answer for a question has an acceptable quantitative answer which is a fraction, players must give that fraction in simplest terms, or as the simplest available decimal or percent representation. (<em>e.g.: "four-eighths" is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "one-half"</em>.)</li>
	<li>If the correct answer for a question has a non-terminating decimal or is an irrational or transcendental number, such that saying the full number aloud is impossible to do in finite time, players must give a finitely-long way of referring to that number as their answer. (<em>E.g.: "3 point 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5..." is never an acceptable answer in place of "pi".</em>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Unless otherwise permitted by the answer line or by question text, descriptive phrases are not acceptable answers when the desired answer is a person, thing, or phenomenon with a defined name or nomenclature. (<em>E.g.: "Uh, the current Pope" is not acceptable when the desired answer is "Pope Francis"</em>.)</li>
	<li>If there are multiple acceptable answers to a question, each answer is equally acceptable unless one of those potential answers is mentioned in a clue within the question text and the moderator has begun reading that potential answer aloud. For the purposes of this rule, "begun" means that the moderator has finished reading the full syllable just prior to the potential answer. (<em>E.g.: If "Samuel Clemens" is an acceptable answer up to a point, and a clue within a question reads "originally named Samuel Clemens," it stops being acceptable as soon as the moderator finishes articulating the /d/ sound in "named"</em>.)</li>
	<li>Unless an answer line expressly allows otherwise, a player's given answer must contain the proper word form(s) which could refer directly to the answer -- a proper noun if the desired answer is a proper noun, an adjective if the desired answer is an adjective, etc. -- and an answer which merely contains another word or phrase derived from the desired answer is not acceptable on its own. (<em>E.g.: "Freudian slip" alone is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "Sigmund Freud," and "spoonerism" is not an acceptable answer if the desired answer is "Reverend William Spooner," unless the answer line permits it.</em>)
<ol type="a">
	<li>If the desired answer to a question is a non-proper noun, all grammatically valid singular and plural given answers are equally acceptable.</li>

<h1 id="h.7hxj5p342ejb">H. Protests</h1>
<ol>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">
<ol>
	<li>A <b>protest</b> is an official action taken by an active player or coach to ensure that possible errors do not disrupt the proper and consistent awarding of points for accurate and specific factual knowledge.</li>
	<li>Any active player or coach may indicate their interest in formally lodging a protest while a match is ongoing, at any pause between questions prior to the point at which that protest would need to be formally lodged (<em>e.g. by quickly and unobtrusively saying "Protest" if it regards the question which was just read, or by quickly and unobtrusively saying "Protest on tossup 7", say, if it regards a question from earlier in the game</em>.) The moderator shall note immediately that this indication of interest was made (<em>e.g. by saying "Noted" and marking the spot corresponding to that question/cycle on the official scoresheet</em>), and then continue reading the next question. Indicating interest in formally lodging a protest does not constitute formally lodging that protest.</li>
	<li>Any active player or coach may formally <b>lodge</b> a protest by stating that they are lodging a protest and explaining the specific substance of the protest. Protests concerning a tossup or bonus within the first ten cycles of a match may only be lodged at halftime. Protests concerning a tossup or bonus between the end of halftime and the end of regulation play may only be lodged within one minute after regulation play (<em>though the stating or writing of an explanation of the protest may take longer than a minute if necessary</em>). Protests on any tiebreaker question may and must be lodged immediately after the affected question has been played.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Active players who are being substituted out must lodge a protest before the substitution occurs. Players who have just been substituted in may not lodge a protest regarding a question that was read when they were non-active.</li>
	<li>The opportunity to start lodging protests ends for a given match as soon as all members of one team have left the game room.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Before the last opportunity to lodge protests for a given game has concluded, the opposing team to any individual protest may <b>concede</b> the validity of a protest, in which case the game state is immediately changed as though that protest were upheld (<em>See H.12</em>), and/or the protesting team may <b>withdraw</b> its own protest, in which case the game state remains as though that protest were denied.</li>
	<li>The following potential errors, and only the following, are protestable:
<ol type="a">
	<li>The protesting player gave an answer which is factually correct and acceptable given the rules and guidelines regarding correctness of answers, and that given answer was not accepted. (<em>This protest may be lodged either in instances of obvious answer line error, such as a tossup on World War II whose listed answer is "Lewis Carroll," or in instances where an always-acceptable alternative answer, such as the original-language title or a plausible pronunciation given English phonetics, is not listed in the answer line or known to be acceptable by the moderator. See Section F, "Ruling on Answers," and Section G, "Detailed Correctness Guidelines".</em>)</li>
	<li>The question text is ambiguous such that, given the entirety of the question text that was read out, the answer the player gave is correct and would reasonably be accepted by an otherwise knowledgeable person without access to the answer line. This type of protest cannot be lodged until at least one clue has been read out in full. <em>(On a tossup, this protest can only be lodged regarding the question text that was read before the affected player buzzed in. See A.7.a regarding what constitutes a clue; this type of protest cannot be lodged unless the moderator has read a set of words that could reasonably be construed as a grammatical sentence, even if a conjunction, semicolon, etc. links that clue to others.</em>)</li>
	<li>The listed acceptable answer in the packet was unreasonably specific, and the player gave an unlisted answer which reasonably uniquely identifies the same thing as the listed answer.</li>
	<li>The tossup or bonus part has no single correct answer, either because distinct clues have been read that each uniquely identify two or more distinct non-interchangeable answers, or because all clues which have been read thus far are factually erroneous, or because clues which have been read thus far fundamentally misidentify the sort of thing the desired answer is (<em>e.g.: repeatedly says "this element" when the desired answer is a chemical compound</em>).</li>
	<li>The player gave a correct but not sufficiently specific answer, and should have been prompted, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted. (<em>This includes, but is not limited to, cases in which the answer line included a prompt instruction that the moderator did not see, or in which the guidelines in Section G would normally provide for a prompt that the moderator did not give</em>.)</li>
	<li>The opposing team gained points for an answer which should have been ruled incorrect, but was ruled correct due either to moderator error or to an error in the packet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Nothing else is protestable.
<ol type="a">
	<li>"What the moderator heard" is not protestable. In cases where both teams agree that the moderator ruled mistakenly on an answer based on a hearing error, they may bring this to the moderator's attention and the moderator will re-evaluate the answer which was actually given.</li>
	<li>Procedural <b>complaint</b>s are not protests. If a participant on either team notices that a game official has made a mistake in adhering to the procedures laid out in these rules, that participant may bring the mistake to the moderator's attention between the reading of one question and the next; the moderator shall then note the issue and determine immediately how to proceed from that point onward. (<em>Some examples of situations that might warrant a procedural complaint include: giving players a one-second warning on tossups, See C.9; failing to give a bounceback opportunity in the event that bouncebacks are being used at the tournament, See Section EX; taking a given answer directed by the wrong player, See Section D; improvising clues not provided in the packet or giving extra hints after all clues to a question have been read, See C.16.</em>) A procedural complaint is never grounds to "restart" the game or replace any questions outside the ongoing cycle or, if it arises between cycles, outside the most recently concluded cycle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li><em><em>(Moderator judgment calls of any kind, such as timing calls, rulings that a buzz was accidental, discovery of conferring, and the levying of sanctions for misconduct, are never protestable.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(The mere fact that a single clue or combination of clues could, in a vacuum, refer to multiple possible answers is not protestable, unless all clues up to the point at which a player buzzed in could refer specifically to the answer the player gave.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(Subjective opinions about the quality of a question, including that a clue was "too early" or "too easy," or that a clue was vague or poorly-phrased or unhelpful, or that a clue was difficult to understand due to grammatical stylistic choices, or that a question was "bad," etc. etc. are never grounds for protest.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(The failure of a question to be of a specific category, or the failure of the questions in a match to conform to an expected "distribution" of categories -- e.g., "this round only had three science tossups" -- is not protestable.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(The mere fact that the answer given by a player is related to the clues in a question, or related to the actual answer of the question, is not protestable. In particular, players may not protest that the answer they gave "is associated with" the clues they heard unless they can specify an issue of factual accuracy under the legitimate grounds for protest listed above.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(The mere presence of a minor factual error is not protestable if that error creates no ambiguity with regard to the desired answer, based on a knowledgeable person's correction of the error. For example: there are no grounds for protest if question text states "The author of the novel Snow Country, Kenzaburo Oe, is from this country," as both the actual author of Snow Country and Kenzaburo Oe are both from Japan, and either way of rectifying the error would uniquely identify the desired answer of Japan.)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(A team may not protest that the opposing team gave an answer which was accepted but should merely have been prompted; e.g. Team A cannot protest that Team B's answer of "Freud" should have required a prompt in the hopes of the more specific answer "Sigmund Freud".)</em></em></li>
	<li><em><em>(A team cannot protest that the other team was prompted, except in cases where giving a prompt on an outright incorrect or unacceptable answer results on an unwarranted chance at points.)</em></em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Multiple protests may be lodged concerning the same question.</li>
	<li>There is no limit to the number of protests a team may lodge during a match. The moderator may judge the excessive lodging of frivolous protests, or the excessive indication of intent to protest, to be misconduct (<em>See Section I</em>).</li>
	<li>While lodging a protest, a team may cite academic sources or resources as needed as evidence for their protest, provided that no player or coach uses any forbidden electronic devices or printed notes/sources while there are still questions yet to read in the game. Citation of, or lookup within, at-hand print or electronic sources after the game to strengthen the rationale for a protest before that protest is reported to the tournament director does not in and of itself constitute cheating, tampering, or any other form of misconduct (<em>See I.5</em>).</li>
	<li>Unless the tournament director dictates otherwise, a protest will be <b>resolve</b>d if and only if resolving that protest could change the win-loss outcome of the match. (<em>Protests which must be resolved are also known as <b>pending</b> protests</em>.) In the event that one or more protests need to be resolved from a particular match, the moderator shall report the specifics of all such protests to the tournament director, and the tournament director shall ensure proper resolution of each protest from that point on. All protests whose resolution could not change the win-loss outcome of the match are rendered <b>moot</b>; moot protests are not relayed or resolved.
<ol type="a">
	<li>In the event that a match has a tied score after regulation play and protests have been lodged which could affect the outcome so as to make the match not a tie upon being resolved, the teams should play through the usual tiebreaker procedure until the match has a winner before any protests are resolved. If the reading of tiebreaker questions determines a winner such that lodged protests would not change the win-loss outcome of the game, those protests become moot and need not be resolved (<em>See C.6.</em>)</li>
	<li>If a match was tied after regulation play, and then a protest from regulation play is upheld, such that the score after regulation play is no longer a tie, all tiebreaker questions and changes in score from any tiebreaker questions are undone prior to other procedures for upholding the protest (<em>See C.6</em>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The tournament director has the ultimate authority to resolve all pending protests; this authority allows for delegating the resolution of protests to another individual official or to a committee, whether that be for the duration of the tournament or on a case-by-case basis.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The tournament director may request or mandate that all protests be delivered by the use of written sheets on which the substance of the protest is explained by each team affected, rather than by a verbal report of the circumstances from the moderator.</li>
	<li>The report of a protest to the tournament director or the tournament director's delegates should never, under any circumstances, disclose the specific team which protested a question. If possible, all information about the specific teams involved in a protest should be redacted when the protest is reported.</li>
	<li>The tournament director's authority to resolve pending protests, and any authority delegated by the tournament director to other people, includes the authority to choose the order in which protests from a single match are resolved in the event that there are multiple protests. If resolving some number of protests within a match renders the remaining protests moot, those mooted protests need not be resolved, irrespective of when they were lodged during the match.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>A protest can be resolved in one of two ways: it can be <b>denied</b> or it can be <b>upheld</b>. If a protest is denied, all original scoring on the affected question(s) remains unchanged. If a protest is upheld, the moderator shall follow the procedures below to restore the condition of the game as though the error had not been made.
<ol type="a">
	<li>(<em>Resolution A</em>) If the protest resolution determines that a player gave a correct answer which was erroneously ruled incorrect (<em>See H.5.a; H.5.b; H.5.c</em>), all existing score changes due the affected tossup or bonus part will be undone (<em>including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</em>), and the player's team will be given the proper number of points for a correct answer. In the event that the incorrect-to-correct change is made regarding a tossup answer, both teams will be reseated as soon as is practicable, a bonus will be read to the player's team, and all points scored on that bonus will be added to the final score.</li>
	<li>(<em>Resolution B</em>) If the protest resolution determines that there was no possible correct answer to a tossup or bonus part (<em>See H.5.d</em>), the question will be thrown out, all score changes due to the affected question will be undone (<em>including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</em>), and a replacement question of the same kind, tossup or bonus, will be read to the same team or teams which were eligible to give an answer before. In the event that a tossup is replaced in this way and the replacement tossup is correctly answered by same team which correctly answered the original tossup, the bonus points from the original bonus are maintained, rather than reading a new bonus; otherwise, a new bonus will be read as necessary to go along with a replacement tossup as soon as is practicable. (<em>Any replacement tossup read in keeping with Resolution B is read to both teams. In the event that a single bonus part is invalidated by Resolution B, an entire replacement bonus is read in accordance with Rule E.10.</em>)</li>
	<li>(<em>Resolution C</em>) If the protest resolution determines that a player or team should have been prompted on a bonus part, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted (<em>See H.5.e</em>), the original bonus will be thrown out and a replacement bonus will be read <em>(See E.10</em>). If the protest resolution determines that a player or team should have been prompted on a tossup, but was ruled incorrect instead of being prompted, the original tossup will be thrown out and a replacement tossup will be read to the protesting team, on which the opposing team may not buzz in. In the event of a replacement tossup, all original scoring from the protested cycle will stand (<em>including any points earned on the bonus within that cycle</em>) unless the protesting team gives a correct answer to the replacement tossup; if the protesting team gives a correct answer to the replacement tossup, it earns a bonus so as to complete a new replacement cycle, all changes in score from the originally-protested cycle are undone, and any new score changes from the replacement cycle are included in the official score.</li>
	<li>(<em>Resolution D</em>) If the protest resolution determines that the opposing team was ruled correct for a given answer which was incorrect (<em>See H.5.f</em>), all changes in score due to the affected question or part will be undone (<em>including all bonus points earned during the affected cycle, in the event that the protest was lodged on a tossup</em>). In the event that the affected question is a tossup and the protesting team lost an opportunity to buzz in due to the error which led to the protest, a replacement tossup will be read which only the protesting team may play.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>If the resolution of a protest creates a tie in score where there was no tie before, the teams will play tiebreaker questions under the usual procedure. (<em>See C.6</em><em>.</em>)</li>
	<li>If a protest resolution results in a replacement tossup taking the place of a pre-existing tiebreaker tossup for which no corresponding bonus is awarded, no bonus is awarded for answering that replacement tossup correctly either.</li>
	<li>The decision of whether to hold teams in the game room while a protest is being resolved, or to let those teams advance to their next match(<em>es</em>) (<em>conveying the protest resolution to those teams later on</em>), is at the tournament director's discretion.</li>
	<li>The decision of whether or not to let moderators conduct <b>provisional gameplay</b> [or <b>hypothetical gameplay</b>] before protests are officially resolved is at the discretion of the tournament director. Provisional gameplay consists of reading any replacement or additional questions which would be required in the event that pending protest(s) are upheld, and taking note of the changes in score that result. In the event that some or all of the pending protest(s) are indeed upheld, the corresponding score changes from hypothetical gameplay are made official.</li>
	<li>A protest is considered resolved once its resolution has been conveyed to both teams. No team may attempt to communicate to the tournament director or the tournament director's delegates about the ongoing resolution of a protest prior to receiving word about the official resolution from tournament staff. Attempting to tamper with the resolution of a protest while it is ongoing is a form of severe misconduct (<em>See I.5.e</em>).</li>
	<li>All protests which require a resolution will be resolved exactly one time. All protest resolutions are final. No protest resolution may be reversed, appealed, or revisited at any time, for any reason.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="h.30rrkd7ee592" style="line-height:1.15;">I. Ethics and Conduct</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Each person present at a quizbowl match or tournament is expected to behave respectfully, courteously, and ethically to all other people present; to respect and follow these rules to the best of their knowledge; and to obey all relevant dictates of the tournament director and other tournament officials. Participants and spectators at quizbowl tournaments are additionally expected to adhere to all applicable local laws, anfd to all administrative rules regarding the appropriate use of facilities and properties in which matches are held.</li>
	<li>All <b>spectator</b>s [or <b>audience member</b>s] who watch a match must be physically separated from all active players and game officials, and may not speak, make deliberate noise, or attempt to communicate nonverbally with active players or game officials while a match is ongoing.
<ol type="a">
	<li>The moderator has the authority to eject any spectator(s) from a game room while the match is ongoing after just one instance of misconduct, without any prior warning.</li>
	<li>In particular, spectators may not encourage either team to lodge a protest. Spectators may not relay outside information (<em>such as information looked up on a mobile electronic device</em>) to players or coaches for the purpose of lodging protests or for any other reason.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><b>Misconduct</b> consists of any behavior which violates the expected respect, courtesy, and ethical obligations required for duly conducting a quizbowl match. The moderator shall have authority to remark upon instances of misconduct as they occur, and sanction them as permitted below, even if it would require pausing the match to do so.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Under no circumstances shall points be deducted from the score of a team within a match, or added to the opposing team's score, to punish a participant or team for engaging in misconduct. The score of a quizbowl match can only be changed by the giving of answers to questions or by the resolution of protests.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><b>Minor misconduct</b> consists of any behavior which briefly disrupts the ability for a match to continue smoothly, efficiently, and fairly. The moderator has the authority and discretion to provide a <b>warning</b> to any participant in a match for their first instance of minor misconduct within that match, and may eject any participant from the room for the remainder of the match for a second or later instance of minor misconduct within that match.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Examples of minor misconduct include the use of psychological ploys to confuse or misdirect the opposing team or the moderator, the deliberate making of disruptive noise (<em>in ways not governed elsewhere in these rules by prohibitions on conferring</em>), or the use of malicious or disrespectful language toward another participant in the match.</li>
	<li>The lodging of <b>frivolous</b> protests, either through repeated lodging of protests regarding matters which are not protestable or through excessive lodging of allowed types of protests on extremely tenuous or speculative factual grounds, constitutes minor misconduct.</li>
	<li><b>Unsportsmanlike delay</b> of game, such as deliberately giving the longest acceptable answer to every question, making requests for score checks after every cycle, etc. constitutes minor misconduct if, in the view of the moderator, it interferes with the swift and timely completion of the match. It never constitutes unsportsmanlike delay of game to use any and all time allotted by these rules to think before giving an answer, or to do so at every available opportunity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li><b>Severe misconduct</b> constitutes any behavior which threatens the very fairness and safety required for quizbowl, as an activity and a community, to continue. The tournament director has the authority to eject any participant from the tournament immediately for one instance of severe misconduct, or for a pattern of lesser misconduct over the course of the day. All decisions by the tournament director regarding ejections are final and may not be appealed.
<ol type="a">
	<li>Any physical <b>violence</b>, attempted physical violence, or physical intimidation committed by any player, coach, spectator, or game official against any player, coach, spectator, game official, or tournament director, or designated assistant of the tournament director, or any <b>destruction of property</b>, be that equipment used in the match or destruction or defacing of property within the game room or host institution, constitutes severe misconduct.</li>
	<li><b>Cheating</b>, defined as any attempt by a competing team member or coach to access question content before it is read out in the proper match, or any deliberate attempt outside the rules to access external information about the potential answers to questions while they are being read, or any deliberate use of an ineligible person as a participant, constitutes severe misconduct. (<em>Use of disallowed personal electronic devices, reference sources, or notes while a match is ongoing constitutes cheating. Outside a tournament itself, conversations about specific question content between a person who has not played a question set with a person who has already played that question set constitute cheating. Playing one question set at a second tournament after already playing it once elsewhere constitutes cheating; the burden is on each team to keep track of which question sets it has already played and where. If a team at a tournament realizes that it has inadvertently already played a question set on which it is competing, that team must immediately report the issue and forfeit all remaining matches at that tournament.</em>) All participants in a match or tournament share responsibility in reporting instances where cheating may have occurred, and are expected to cooperate fully in investigations of potential cheating.</li>
	<li><b>Throwing a match</b>, defined as any attempt by one or more participants to set the winner and loser of a match before that match is played, or to fix the relative standings of teams at a tournament or subcomponent of a tournament before it has concluded, constitutes severe misconduct. All teams are expected to play honestly and to the best of their ability with the aim of winning each game, irrespective of the place of any other team(s) in the tournament standings or any other factor. Automatic forfeits of a scheduled match due to one team's absence from the tournament, medical emergency, and irreparable scenarios of that sort do not constitute throwing a match.</li>
	<li><b>Extreme partiality</b> of game officials, such as grossly unfair or inequitable application of these rules in favor of one team or school, or attempts to unduly influence the officiation of a match in favor of one team or school, or other behavior which compromises the effective neutrality of a game official between competing teams, constitutes severe misconduct. Any player or coach present for a match may report instances of extreme partiality to the tournament director or, if the tournament director is not available, to another game official. The tournament director has the authority to dismiss and/or replace game officials who are found to demonstrate extreme partiality.</li>
	<li><b>Tampering</b> with tournament director decisions, including seeking out the tournament director to argue for a favorable protest resolution for one's team while a protest is still under review, intimidating tournament officials into changing the schedule of matches, entering into a designated staff-only room without invitation, etc. constitutes severe misconduct. Pointing out an earnest mistake (<em>e.g.: one team is slated to be in two places at once</em>) does not constitute tampering.</li>
	<li>The use of <strong>epithets or slurs</strong> insulting a participant's race, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, etc. constitutes severe misconduct.</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>The current or past institutional affiliations of a game official, or lack thereof, are never in and of themselves sufficient cause to allege misconduct. (<em>For example, if the moderator is a current student, alumnus/a, or faculty member of one of the schools competing in a match, the other school does not have grounds to allege extreme partiality or demand a replacement moderator on that grounds alone</em>.)</li>
	<li>At the discretion of the tournament director, either while a tournament is ongoing or afterward, the results of matches in which severe misconduct was found to occur may be changed to forfeits. Teams with just one member who has engaged in severe misconduct may be removed from further contention at that tournament in such a way as the tournament director sees fit.</li>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[The three tournaments which ACF puts together each year are <b><i>packet-submission</i></b> tournaments. This means that, by and large, each team* contributes a well-distributed round of questions** which the editors can make use of to help put together a set for nationwide use. This guide is a brief explanation of what the ACF packet-submission model is, where it came from, and why we make use of it.

(*There is an exception made for teams made up of new players. Broadly speaking, if all players on a team are in their first or second year of playing college quizbowl, submitting a packet is optional; if any member of a team is in their third year of college quizbowl or further, submitting a packet is required for that team. For the full explanation, see the ACF <a href="https://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/packet-submission-guidelines/">Packet Submission Guidelines</a>.)

(**As of 2015, ACF Fall requests that each team submit a <i>half-packet; </i>ACF Regionals and ACF Nationals each ask for a full packet).
<h2>History</h2>
A standard college quizbowl tournament is an all-day event. Teams might play ten, twelve, or fourteen games from morning to early evening. And each of those games makes use of a packet of dozens of questions on a variety of subjects. Assembling a question set for use at quizbowl tournaments is no easy task, and making sure that the subjects asked about conform to what teams know about and are excited to answer questions on isn't any easier. From the earliest days of quizbowl, the issue of how to have enough fresh questions to play on at each new tournament has been a pressing one. At a time when there were few renowned editors and no unified standards for set production, tournament quality varied wildly.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the era in which ACF emerged, some of the early architects of college quizbowl devised a solution. For any given tournament, each attending team would write its own packet of questions and send them into the editor for central editing. (This was typically done by email even then, though in the very early days some teams sent typed-up questions through the post!) In short order, then, the editor of an invitational tournament could have 11 packets ready for use if 11 teams were attending. And upon arriving at the tournament, that meant each team could play every other team in a round-robin or similar schedule, getting a "bye round" while its own packet was read. Sometimes arrangements were a little more complicated -- two schools in different geographic areas might ask each team attending their own event to submit a packet, and then do a "packet swap" across locations -- but the basics remained pretty similar.

At that time, editing was often a lot less intensive than it is today, if it existed at all. Standards of good quizbowl writing, such as pyramidality, were a thing of the future, and deprecated question types such as speed check tossups and spelling questions were still around. Different teams might write packets of wildly different difficulty, making rounds at the same event quite uneven. Repeats of answers or clues between packets were often numerous and flagrant. From its early days onward, ACF put a major emphasis on central editing and on ensuring consistent  question quality and difficulty across all packets submitted to its events. In order to help reduce the risk of repeats, and to allow the editors more selection in shaping the final set, it became standard to ask teams to submit a somewhat larger packet than the final rounds of the tournament required (as of now, it's 24 tossups and 24 bonuses, somewhat larger than the ACF standard 20/20 distribution). Ad-hoc "packet swap" or "mirror" arrangements were phased out in favor of the option to combine several teams' submitted packets (typically 2 to 3) into a single finalized packet for play across all sites in all regions. And as the ACF tournament network took off and became a centralized institution in the college quizbowl landscape, our members committed to helping "house-written" tournaments reach the same standards.
<h2>Why does ACF do Packet Submission?</h2>
As time goes on, the use of packet submission across the collegiate circuit is on the decline. While it was once the case a few years ago that the majority of college tournaments were held on a packet-submission model, it is now more common for a single school or unified writing team to put together an entire set without any input from playing teams at all. Nonetheless, ACF stands by its packet-submission tradition for several reasons, foremost among them the reasons listed here.
<h3>It encourages learning</h3>
At its heart, quizbowl is a game about learning. And writing for a packet can be quite an educational activity.  The packet submission expectation helps teams accustom themselves to the idea that quizbowl is as much about finding out new facts as it is about showing off the facts one knows already, and that being intellectually curious is the path to success. Assuming for a second that a team of four players attends all of ACF Fall, ACF Regionals, and ACF Nationals each year, and that the team splits its packet-writing obligations evenly, each player has a chance to master 36 topics (6 tossups and 6 bonuses times three packets) as they write, which improves their skill at quizbowl and gives them information they can take with them in the rest of their academic lives.

What's more, some savvy teams have taken the packet-submission requirement into account for strategic reasons -- e.g. writing on topics that their team is <i>weak</i> at, in the hopes that their submission would preclude more questions on that same topic area elsewhere in the tournament. Of course, researching and writing on one's weaknesses often enough can turn those weaknesses into strengths down the line!
<h3>It allows regular players to influence the future direction of the game</h3>
Packet submission allows players from across the country to introduce fresh topics, ideas, clues, and approaches into the mix of topics that come up at quizbowl tournaments. This prevents the "canon" of frequent topics asked by the college game from getting stale with time, and allows for overlooked information to get its due. If there's an underrepresented topic out there, submitting it in a packet to Fall, Regionals, or Nationals as appropriate can bring it into the world of quizbowl for others to learn about, benefit from, and perhaps begin writing questions on themselves. (Again, this requirement can be used strategically to write on a topic one wants to see come up more often, in the hopes that other teams will learn it and find it important enough to write on in <i>their</i> packets.)

What's more, it helps the community discover that segment of players who genuinely feel the joy of writing; for such players, submitting packets to tournaments can be the impetus they need to sign up for an independent writing job, or apply to edit for ACF Fall.
<h3>It helps our editors produce the best sets possible</h3>
Even the most accomplished and prolific editors develop writer's block, or get stuck on a stale set of ideas from time to time; such is the nature of any creative enterprise. Receiving an infusion of question ideas, clues, and answers from teams across the country helps editors make sure they aren't overlooking any major subdistributional areas, and can increase the likelihood that a tournament is well-balanced rather than lopsided towards the editors' own interests.
<h3>It helps preserves ACF's unique role as an organization of, by, and for the players of college quizbowl</h3>
Unlike many other extracurricular competition organizations, ACF is composed of the very players and community members it aims to serve. Much like college teams, ACF members arise and depart as the years go by; the organization couldn't survive if there weren't a thriving community of people surrounding it, and college quizbowl would have trouble surviving if its players didn't have some skin in the game. More positively, a world where every team writes questions several times a year helps bridge the gap between editors and regular players, and helps demonstrate that writing and editing are something any team can do if they see fit, rather than activities reserved for a distant company or top tier of talented players. The difference between an ACF editor and a player at an ACF tournament is a difference of degree, not a difference of kind -- we are all members of the same community, and the use of team-submitted packets preserves the spirit of players writing for and sharing their knowledge with each other that ACF uniquely embodies.
<h2>We spent a bunch of time working on our packet and it didn't get used / barely got used. What can we do to prevent that in the future?</h2>
In recent years, as ACF tournament fields have grown massively across the country, and Fall and Regionals receive dozens of packet submissions for use in constructing only 16 to 18 finalized packets for play, it has become more likely that any particular submitted packet will need to be combined with other submissions or cut outright (i.e. left largely or wholly unused). Ultimately there are no guarantees -- from tournament to tournament, category to category, and packet to packet, different editors might be looking for different things -- but here are some suggestions which will in aggregate make it more likely that your work will see use in an ACF tournament:

<b><b>Submit your packet as early as possible.</b> </b>More than just about any other factor, submitting your team's packet early is the best way to increase its chance of being used. It is often the case that the editors can make use of a merely-decent packet submitted at the first deadline, when relatively few packets have come in; it is much less possible to try and fix up a merely-decent packet at the last deadline or beyond, when many finalized packets are done already and time is tight. Additionally, you are likely to net your team a significant discount off entry fees, and the editors will be happy with you for pitching in early, so really everybody wins! (Make sure you get enough of a head start that you aren't sacrificing question quality, though.)

  <title>Qualifying for ACF Nationals</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Teams may qualify for ACF Nationals in the following ways:

1) <b>Clubs who are hosting ACF Regionals:</b> Each host may apply for one host bid, which will be evaluated by an ACF committee after the fall semester of tournaments has concluded. In their bid, teams must specify a roster of up to four players. The task of the committee will be to determine if this roster would be likely to qualify for Nationals based on the below criteria, using its performance at fall tournaments as the primary factor. If the team’s host bid is denied, then the club must play a house team to qualify. Clubs are responsible for making necessary arrangements to properly staff their ACF Regionals events in the event that they play house teams for any reason, including but not limited to host bids being denied or seeking to qualify a second team. Playing or qualifying additional teams at Regionals has no impact on the host bid decision or status. However, the team members listed in the bid roster may not play Regionals; experienced players should be used as tournament staffers.

1a) <b>Teams with an ACF Regionals editor</b> who do not host a tournament site and <b>teams that are more than 400 miles from the nearest Regionals site</b> may apply for bids through the same process as host teams.

2) <b>Any team that wins an ACF Regionals tournament</b> at which at least four total teams from at least two total schools are present will receive an automatic bid.

3) <b>Any team that wins the Undergraduate title</b> at an ACF Regionals tournament at which at least four total Undergraduate teams from at least two total schools are present will receive an automatic bid.

4) <b>All remaining teams are ranked on their “A-value.”</b>
<div>There are four key components to A-value:</div>
<div></div>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Tossup points per tossup heard (TUPPTUH):</strong> How many points each team scored, only counting tossups and negs, divided by the number of tossups they heard.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonus conversion (PPB):</strong> Points per bonus.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bonuses heard per tossup heard (BHPTUH):</strong> The percentage of tossups a team answered correctly out of all the tossups they heard.</li>
 	<li><strong>Strength of schedule (SOS):</strong> The combined points per tossups heard of each team's opponents <em>in other games</em>, weighted by how many times they played each opponent, divided by the average points per tossup heard over the entire field. If a team has played a slate of opponents of perfectly average strength, this will be 1, with higher values indicating a tougher schedule.</li>
</ul>
<div class="gmail_default"></div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The raw A-value calculation is </span></div>
<div class="gmail_default">
<pre>20 * (TUPPTH * SOS + BHPTUH * SOS * PPB)</pre>
</div>
<div class="gmail_default"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div>This is designed to be reflective of a team's performance in an average game, corrected for strength of competition. In addition, ACF also uses a correction for order of finish, designed to preserve the order of finish at Regionals sites in the A-value ranking. If a team finishes above another team with a higher A-value, the A-values of those teams and all teams between them in the standings are averaged and the resulting teams are sorted by order of finish at Regionals.</div>
<div></div>
Teams will then be invited to join the ACF Nationals field in descending order of A-value, until the field fills or the bid acceptance deadline passes (see below).

5) <b>All teams that qualify by one of the above procedures must inform ACF of the acceptance of their bid by February 13, 2019.</b> Note that “bid acceptance” is a completely separate process from actually submitting your optional packet—you may submit a packet before you have been officially offered a spot in the field in order to secure a larger discount, but you will only enter the field once you have accepted your bid. Furthermore, if you submit a packet before registering for the tournament and subsequently do not attend ACF Nationals, whether because you do not qualify or because you choose not to attend, that packet will be treated as a freelance submission; you may <b>not</b> use those questions for another future packet-submission tournament.

6) If the field does not fill once the bid acceptance deadline is reached, then any team eligible to play ACF tournaments may attend ACF Nationals, with available spots being award in order of A-value.

There are no restrictions on what Regionals site a school may attend. There are no special considerations or penalties given to B teams, with the exception of the host roster rule explained above.]]></content:encoded>
