<h2><span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Fall and ACF Regionals</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Bidding process<br />
</strong>If you would like to host a tournament in your region, contact the appropriate editor at the address listed above. In general, based on where quizbowl programs are distributed, ACF considers North America to be divided into the regions of: Northeast (New England), Mid-Atlantic (New York to North Carolina), Southeast (Tennessee and its bordering states), Florida, South Plains (Oklahoma/Texas area), Midwest (Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and their bordering states), North Midwest (Minnesota/Iowa), California, Northwest (Washington, British Columbia, and their bordering states and provinces), and East Canada (Ontario and its bordering provinces). Ideally, every tournament would have ten hosts, one in each of those locations. However, sometimes there is not enough interest to host the tournament in a given region, and sometimes the hosts are located towards the edge of a traditional region, necessitating the creation of new sites. For example, if the "Midwest" site is in Michigan and the "South Plains" site is in Texas, then there may be another site created in Missouri for nearby teams to attend more conveniently.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">When the editors receive more than one host bid from a given region, they will choose the host based primarily on a combination of two factors: whom they expect to attract more teams, and whom they expect to run the best tournament based on past hosting performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Ideally, all bids will be received no later than twelve weeks before the tournament date, and the editors will award bids to hosts in each of the ten regions no later than ten weeks before the tournament date. In reality, only the more active regions are likely to have their bids decided by that time, and it may take some additional weeks before a host can be found in a less active region, so the announcement of bids may be staggered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial breakdown between hosts and editors<br />
</strong>The base fee for each "normal" team that participates in your tournament is $120, as described in the packet and fee guidelines. Of this, you can consider $70 the base fee for you, the host, and $50 the base fee for the editors. All packet discounts and penalties (including early/late packet adjustments, and supplementary penalties for formatting or plagiarism) are added to or subtracted from the $50 that is to be paid to the editors: For example, if a team submits their packet at the -$25 deadline, then (ignoring all other discounts) they pay you $95, and you still keep $70 and only send the editors $25 for that team, since the $25 comes out of the editors' share. Similarly, all logistical discounts for buzzers, laptops, staffers, and travel affect your cut: A team that has no packet adjustment and brings 1 buzzer and 1 staffer to the tournament pays $105; you keep $55 and send the editors $50, since the logistical discounts come out of your share. The $25 "new ACF team" discount is split 15/10: Take $15 out of the editors' share, and $10 out of the hosts' share.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The following unusual cases will have their fees split up differently: Teams which receive the new quizbowl team discount, teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, and house teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">For teams which receive the "new quizbowl team discount" of $100, you do not owe the editors anything. Any money they do pay is yours. Normally, such teams will pay around $20. ACF asks for the cooperation of tournament directors in welcoming new teams into quizbowl by taking significantly less money from such teams than from all others.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">For teams charged under the shorthanded team discount, the final fee, whatever it may be, is split in a 3:2 ratio between the hosts and the editors. For example, for a shorthanded team whose final fee is $35, the host keeps $21 and the editors get $14.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">For house teams, you do not owe the editors anything and the teams are not required to write packets. However, you have an option of writing a packet for the house team to save money: If your house team (or any combination of your house team and the people staffing the tournament) writes an acceptable packet by the no-penalty deadline, then you can take a -$50 discount off of the total amount that you owe to the editors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">ACF does not expect you to lose money by allowing a team into your tournament. In the unlikely event that a strict reading of these guidelines implies that you owe the editors more money for a particular team than that team actually is supposed to pay you, the amount you owe will be adjusted downwards so that this does not occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Financial viability<br />
</strong>Based on past tournaments, you can expect the average ACF event to attract 8 to 12 teams and bring in a gross amount of $1200. You should expect to spend about $100 on prizes and other logistical costs of your tournament, send $500 to the editors, and keep $600 as your team's profit. Obviously, these numbers can vary significantly in any direction depending on the circumstances of your particular tournament and are not a guarantee, but generally teams have found hosting ACF events to be a positive contribution to quizbowl as well as a good way to raise money for their own tournament-attendance schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Host requirements<br />
</strong>Hosts must use the posted fee schedule for ACF tournaments. However, ACF is willing to allow hosts to make certain changes to the fee schedule if it promises to attract more teams. Please contact the tournament editor for more details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must announce their tournament to the Quizbowl Resource Center and their local mailing lists in a timely fashion. The editors will endeavor to finalize the host bids at least two weeks in advance of the first packet deadline (and thus, ten weeks before the tournament itself) at which time all hosts should put out their announcements. Each announcement should explicitly state, at a minimum, the date and day of the week of the tournament (which will normally be Saturday, but can be Sunday in some cases); the name and e-mail address of the person taking team registrations; and the link to official ACF information on packet submission.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must use the official <a style="color:#999999;" title="Official ACF Rules" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/official-acf-rules/">ACF rules</a> for gameplay and tournaments formats, as well as supplementary material on required tournament formats for certain numbers of teams that will be sent out by the tournament editor.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must keep statistics for the entire tournament using the SQBS program, fully and accurately entering all team, individual, and packet statistics that the program uses (remember to enable "round reports"), and publicly post all SQBS reports no later than the Sunday evening following the tournament. If you prefer to use a different program during the tournament itself and redo the stats in SQBS for posting later, that is fine. SQBS is available for free at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/index.html">here</a> . If you do not have webspace, e-mail all of your SQBS output files to the tournament editor and the editor will post the files for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Unless a host receives explicit permission from the head editor to run fewer, at least ten meaningful games must be offered to all teams. ACF recommends offering at least eleven games.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">We encourage all hosts to run their tournaments digitally in order to be environmentally responsible and save on the time and cost of copying. To this end, all hosts are required, in the standard ACF entry fee schedule, to offer laptop discounts. You can also use a team's PC laptop to run SQBS if you do not have your own access to a capable machine for doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Hosts must provide the appropriate trophies and prizes to teams, as described below. The cost of trophies and prizes, and other tournament expenses, is borne entirely by the hosts and does not affect the calculation of the editors' share of the entry fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Trophies:</em> The top two overall teams should receive trophies in all cases. If the host reasonably expects at least four undergraduate and/or four Division II teams to play the tournament at the time when the trophies are ordered, then the top undergraduate team and the top Division II team should each receive a trophy. In fields of four or more teams competing for these titles, the top undergraduate and Division II teams will always be officially recognized as the undergraduate or Division II champions of the tournament, even if trophies are not available.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Prizes:</em> At a minimum, the members of the top two overall teams, and the top four individual scorers, should receive book prizes. Used books that you can acquire for a few dollars each are perfectly acceptable. For tournaments of ten or more teams, it is strongly preferred that you also give book prizes to the next four overall scorers and to the top four undergraduate and Division II scorers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Payment from hosts to editors<br />
</strong>You must postmark your check to the head editor for the full amount of the editors' share no later than two weeks after the tournament occurs. Only institutional and personal checks will be accepted - no money orders, no cash, and no purchase orders. If you have teams in your field who negotiated for late payment, then the editors will adjust the initially owed amount for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Make it clear to your teams that they need to pay you on or before the morning of the tournament unless they make a specific arrangement with you for delayed payment. If you have problems collecting entry fees from your teams, contact the editors and they will help you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Many past tournaments have had to pull teeth in order to get hosts to pay the editors on time or at all. This is not acceptable and will not continue in the future. Editors put in a huge amount of work, make your tournament possible, and make it very explicit what they are owed when entering into the hosting agreement with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If you have a particularly strange procedure at your school for cutting checks that may make it difficult to meet the two-week deadline, then please make this clear to editors several weeks BEFORE your tournament occurs, and they will negotiate a different deadline with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>For ACF Nationals</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The bidding process for ACF Nationals occurs over the summer immediately following the previous ACF Nationals, with the goal of announcing a site no later than September, so that teams may have the entire academic year to plan their trips before Nationals occurs in April. The primary factors in choosing a Nationals site include the need to rotate the tournament to different areas of the country over time, and the need to staff a tournament of 30 or more teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">For ACF Nationals, the host school will receive $20 per team in attendance for use of the rooms, $10 per staffer provided, and the right to enter one house team for free. If the house team would normally be required to write a packet, then they must do so by the no-penalty deadline. Additional house teams will also be free, but will be allowed only if the tournament has adequate staff, and still must write packets by the no-penalty deadline if required to do so under the packet guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If ACF Nationals is officially designated as being "co-hosted" by multiple teams, then the other teams, besides the one at whose school the tournament is physically occurring, will also receive $10 per staffer provided.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The rest of the entry fees for ACF Nationals goes to the editors, who will be responsible for providing trophies and prizes and covering the other normal expenses of the tournament.</span></p>
