<h2><a name="who"></a>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
<p>Any team with <em>at least</em> one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2015 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2016-2017.</p>
<p>FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.</p>
<p>This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/contacts/">contact the ACF editor for the tournament</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="sample"></a>Sample Packet</h2>
<p>Want to know what a well-formatted packet looks like? Take a look at this packet ACF member Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.</p>
<p>[googleapps domain="docs" dir="document/d/1VcuDQbNYG124iqvBu6AdXbcUq-3sOc_YP_dyjXvXTFE/pub" query="embedded=true" width="800" height="400" /]</p>
<h2><a name="distribution"></a>Distribution</h2>
<p>All Full Packet submissions should have 24 tossups and 24 bonuses according to the distribution outlined below.</p>
<p>The following distribution applies to ACF Regionals and ACF Nationals Submissions. See the <a href="#">2015 ACF Fall Announcement</a> for information about half-packet distributions. </p>
<p><em>Note: The X/Y notation used throughout this section refers to X tossups and Y bonuses. Eg. If you see Fine Arts 3/3, it means 3 tossups and 3 bonuses. </em></p>
<h3>Literature 5/5</h3>
<ul>
<li>American literature: 1/1</li>
<li>British literature: 1/1</li>
<li>European literature from 500 CE onwards: 1/1</li>

<li>Anything you want, including ancient European literature, more of any category above, or combinations of categories above: 1/2 or 2/1</li>
</ul>
<p><em> Vary questions across time periods. Do not write more than 1 question on very recent (post-1990) literature. Please make sure your questions span a variety of answers such as authors, novels, poems, criticism, essays, etc.</em><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h3>History 5/5</h3>
<ul>
<li>American history: 1/1</li>
<li>European, Canadian, and Australian history: 3/3 (1 should be on classical history, 1 on British history, and 3 on continental Europe from three different post-classical time periods.)</li>
<li>World history: 1/1 (from two different areas of the world besides those covered above)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You may write up to 4 questions on military history (battles, wars, or people known primarily for their military accomplishments.)</em></p>
<h3>Science 5/5</h3>

<li>Any science: 1/1 (you can write a math question here if you wrote computer science above, or earth science here if you wrote astronomy above, but don’t write a second question on any of the “minor” fields. Questions which straddle the line between disciplines should be used for Any Science. You can also just write more biology, chemistry, or physics here.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You may write up to 1 question on the history of science. Questions on famous experiments which focus on the scientific principles at work are considered science rather than science history. </em></p>
<h3>Religion, Mythology and Philosophy 3/3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Religion: 1/1 (different religions)</li>
<li>Mythology: 1/1 (different myth systems)</li>

<h3>Fine Arts 3/3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Painting: 1/1</li>

<p><em>Write on a visual category and an auditory art Other Fine Arts. E.g. pick jazz and photography, or opera and architecture, but not opera and jazz.</em></p>
<h3>Social Science 1/1</h3>
<p>Possible topics for this category include economics, psychology, sociology, linguistics, anthropology, political science, social criticism, and law. (Questions on Supreme Court cases go under history; other law questions may go here.)</p>

<p>Possible topics for this category include physical features, countries, cities, regions, etc. Ethnic groups can be geography; languages are more likely social science.</p>
<p><em>Do not write both questions on the same kind of political or physical feature, such as rivers, bodies of water, mountains, cities etc. Do not write both questions on the same area of the world. </em></p>
<h3>Trash, current events, or your choice 1/1</h3>
<p>You can write anything you wish here except for topics included in the other broad categories above. You can write questions which mix categories here.</p>
<p><em>Do not write more than one trash question</em> <em>from the same general category. E.g. Don’t write two questions on sports.</em></p>
<h2><a name="philosophy"></a>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
<p>Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.</p>
<h3>Tossups</h3>
<p>A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.</p>
<p>Do NOT write tossups which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geared towards specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
<p>Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>An easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.</p>
<p>You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.</p>
<p>We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, <a href="#dp">click here</a>.</p>
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
<p>Please follow the ACF Formatting Guidelines when formatting your packet.</p>
<p>Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</li>
<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</li>
<li><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or an “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="how"></a>How to submit your packet</h2>
<h3>Document format</h3>
<p>Please submit your packet as a .doc, .docx, or .rtf file. Submit all questions in 10-point Times New Roman font. Your document should have 1-inch margins on all sides. PDFs, .odt, .html, .txt or any other formats are <strong>not acceptable</strong>.</p>
<p><em>If editors cannot open your packet on the first try, they will return your packet to you and have you re-send a fixed version before it is considered submitted for fee purposes.</em></p>
<h3>Document Name</h3>
<p>Please follow the following file-naming scheme when submitting packets:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;">&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt; - &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt;</p>
<p>For instance, if UC Irvine’s A team is submitting a packet for 2015 ACF Regionals, it should be named:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ACF Regionals 2015 – UC Irvine A</p>
<h2><a name="dp"></a>Discounts/Penalties</h2>
