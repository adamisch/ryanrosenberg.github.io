<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Submission schedule and additional discounts:<br />
</strong>The discount/penalty schedule will be announced shortly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet penalties</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Several teams continue to submit incorrectly formatted packets despite the guidelines clearly stated on the <a style="color:#999999;" title="Packet Submission Guidelines" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Question Formatting Guidelines</a> document.
