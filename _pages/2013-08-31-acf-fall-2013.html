<p><span style="color:#999999;">We'd like to see ACF Fall hosted at each of the above regions. A Missouri site may be reasonable depending on the distances to the host sites in nearby regions, but if you wish to host in the Missouri area please do not hesitate to contact me. In general, hosting this tournament is a good way to cut down on travel costs, raise money, and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you have any interest in hosting or questions about it, please refer first to the official ACF Hosting Guidelines (available here: http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2012-13-hosting-guidelines/) and then e-mail Stephen Liu at the Gmail address acf.fall.2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The deadline for bids is September 14, 2013. Bids will not be accepted after that point, and earlier bids will receive priority over later bids, all else being equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> As per the ACF submission rules, any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2012 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2013-2014. This includes ACF Fall. Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament. As of a recent rule change, high school players are now included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams. (For more on high school teams, please see below.) Please submit packets to the same Gmail account, "acf.fall.2013", and use “ACF Fall 2013: [Team Name]” in the subject line.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Please take a moment to review the ACF Packet Guidelines on formatting to make sure you format your packet correctly.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. People caught plagiarizing will be subject to large fines and public shaming.</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please see the additional packet penalties section for more info.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Note Regarding High School Teams</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> High school teams are welcome to play this tournament, though they should keep in mind that while this may be a lower difficulty tournament, it is nevertheless a collegiate event and significantly more difficult than many high school tournaments. There will be no further discounts for things like playing short-handed or being new to ACF or quizbowl, which applies only to new college teams. Furthermore, high school teams must write a packet if any of its members played a college tournament prior to the 2012-2013 competition season.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Friendly Reminders</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Please refer to the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Guidelines</a> document for more detailed explanations of packet submission and fee-related information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets or talk about their contents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2013 is the same as it has been for the past four years, such as can be seen in ACF Fall 2009 and ACF Fall 2010. These tournaments can be found at <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a>. Remember above all that the tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before, in both your answerlines and your selection of clues. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please let Stephen know at the email address listed above.</span></p>
