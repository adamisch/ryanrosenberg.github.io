<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN SENT INTO HIATUS DUE TO LOW INTEREST.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">ACF sponsors a writer feedback program designed to help quizbowlers of every level improve their question writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">How it works: send up to 5 questions toÂ <a style="color:#808080;" href="mailto:feedback.acf@gmail.com">feedback.acf@gmail.com</a>, along with what level the questions are for and what you'd most like help with. We'll assign a member of ACF to correspond with you and give you feedback on your writing by reading your questions, critiquing them, and suggesting possible changes. We'll also try to answer any questions about writing for quizbowl that you may have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">This program is open to all with no restrictions on who can participate. Everyone who wants to become a better writer, no matter how experienced you are, is welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">If you'd like to use these questions at a college tournament, send a preliminary email with no questions attached to ensure that no one playing that tournament is able to see the questions. This preliminary email should state the tournament to which you plan to submit the questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Also, if you are interested in ongoing feedback, please only submit one group of questions every two weeks; as a new program, we want to make sure we don't overtax our volunteers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">We look forward to receiving your questions and helping improve your writing!</span></p>
