<h2>Who needs to submit packets?</h2>
<p>Any team with <em>at least</em> one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament (either as a college student or as a high school student) prior to September 1, 2013 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2014-2015.</p>
<blockquote><p>FAQ: What counts as a “<strong>Regular, Collegiate, Academic quizbowl tournament</strong>”?</p>
<p>All ACF tournaments, NAQT Division I or Division II SCT, NAQT ICT, and typical academic invitationals and summer opens count as regular collegiate academic tournaments.</p>
<p>Trash or “hybrid” tournaments, College Bowl/HCASC, and tournaments played on NAQT “Invitational Series” questions do not.</p></blockquote>
<p>This test is applied to individual team, not to your school’s contingent as a whole. If you are unsure about whether you are required to write a packet, then please contact the ACF editor for the tournament.</p>
<h2>Question-writing philosophy</h2>
<h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
<p>Consult individual tournament announcements for difficulty guidelines.</p>
<h3>Tossups</h3>
<p>A simple, two-line description of good tossup writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Write your tossups on easier topics. Use challenging clues for the leadin, and use progressively easier clues. End your tossups with a giveaway that most in the field would know.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do NOT write tossups which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geared toward specific players. You should write your questions for a general audience.</li>
<li>Heavy on difficult or easy clues. Make sure you devote appropriate amounts of space to hard, medium, and easy clues.</li>
<li>On your pet topics or things which are likely to go unanswered. Dead tossups are the enemy of fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
<p>Nearly all bonuses should have 3 parts worth 10 points each. Bonuses should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clearly discernable easy part – one which 90% of the field should be able to convert;</li>
<li>A ‘medium’ part – one which roughly 50% of the field should be able to convert; and</li>
<li>A ‘hard’ part – one which a person well-read in the subject of the should be able to convert.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure about the difficulty of a bonus you are writing, then you should err on the side of easier or write on something else entirely.</p>
<p>You may, very occasionally, write a bonus with four parts, two worth 5 and two worth 10.</p>
<p>We prohibit specific types of bonuses and levy penalties on teams that submit packets with prohibited formats. For more information, click here.</p>
<h3>More guidance on writing questions</h3>
<p>Please follow the <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/acf-formatting-guidelines">ACF Formatting Guidelines</a> when formatting your packet.</p>
<p>Several ACF editors have provided tips on how to write good questions. Please consult the following guides:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/">Jerry Vinokurov's Guide to Writing Questions</a> is intended for newcomers and has guides on basic principles of good writing.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/subash-maddipotis-tips-on-question-writing/">Subash Maddipotti’s Tips on Question Writing</a> provide excellent advice on what to avoid when writing questions.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/regular-difficulty/">Andrew Hart’s Primer on Regular Difficulty</a> is an excellent resource for teams writing questions for ACF Regionals (or a “Regular Difficulty” tournament.)</p>
<h3> Past ACF Events as models</h3>
