<p><em>A friendly reminder: ACF editors will charge a </em><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/tournaments/2014-15-packet-submission-guidelines/#dp"><em>penalty</em></a><em> if you do not meet the guidelines below. So pay close attention to this section. </em></p>
<h2>Content Formatting</h2>
<h3>Fonts, Margins, etc.</h3>
<p>Your submitted packet should be in Size 10 Times New Roman font. The margins should be 1 inch on all sides. The lines should be single spaced and spacing between paragraphs should be 0pt.</p>
<p><em>Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</em></p>
<h3>Packet Header</h3>
<p>In the first two lines, place the following in bold text:</p>
<p>&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt;<br />
Packet by &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt; (Player1, Player2, Player3, etc.)</p>
<p>You should include the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Eg.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>ACF Regionals 2014<br />
Packet by Reno Tech B (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong></p>
<h3>Tossup formatting</h3>
<p>Tossups should be 6-7 lines in length, with the occasional tossup going into the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> line. The last sentence of a tossup should begin with “For 10 points” (and not “FTP” or “F10P”) followed by a comma and a space.</p>
<p><em>Do not number or indent your tossups</em>. <em>Do not include power-marks in your tossups</em>.</p>
<h3>Bonus formatting</h3>
<p>Bonuses should have parts that are two lines long, with an occasional part that goes into the third line. Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Bonus leadin</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The first line of a bonus, the leadin, should include a description of the point values for the bonus parts. i.e., if it is a 3-part bonus, it should say “for 10 points each.” Else, it should say, “for the stated number of points.”</p>
<h3>Answer-line formatting</h3>
<p>The answer for any tossup or bonus part should be in its own line. The line should begin with the text “ANSWER: “; that is, the word “ANSWER” in all caps, followed by a colon and a space.</p>
<p>The required part of an answer should be <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">underlined and bolded</span></strong>. If the answer is the title of a work like a book, a play, an opera, a painting, a film, etc. <em>it should be italicized</em>. If it is something contained within a larger collection, e.g. a short story, a chapter, a song, etc. it should be contained within quotes.</p>
<p>Any instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or additional instructions for moderators should be contained within brackets.</p>
<h3>Standardization of numbers</h3>
<p>To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. “twenty-two years”, “a million dollars” and “fourteen hundred casualties,” but “For 10 points” and “1976.”)</p>
<p>Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.</p>
<h3>Other notes on formatting and grammar</h3>
<p>Please delete all internal notes and conversations from the packet before submitting it.</p>
<p>If there is a note that you would like to convey to the editors, please add it as a comment using MS Word, or leave a line before or after the question.</p>
<p><em>Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</em></p>
<p><em>Avoid using special characters if possible</em>. Characters with accents and other diacritical marks are okay.</p>
<h2>Organizing your packet</h2>
<p>Group your questions by category. Tossups should appear before bonuses. The ordering of the categories does not matter. Within a category, the ordering of sub-categories doesn’t matter, either.</p>
<p>Take a look at this packet our editor Rob Carson submitted for ACF Regionals 2014.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do NOT randomize your packet. We will return your packet to you if you submit a randomized packet.</em></strong></p>
