<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong><strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Logistical information</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">ACF Nationals this year will be held at the University of Maryland in colorful College Park, Maryland. The tournament will last all day on Saturday, April 21 and conclude on the morning of Sunday, April 22.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be the head editor of this tournament and will post information on packet submission shortly.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Matt Weiner will be Tournament Director. Nationals will be a fully staffed, efficiently run tournament with a sensible format that remembers to award the Undergraduate and Division II trophies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Information on hotels and such is to follow. If you have any questions about the logistics of ACF Nationals that you need answered right now, feel free to post here or e-mail Matt Weiner at mattweiner.vcu@gmail.com. We're looking forward to a healthy field and a great event.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Jonathan Magin will be taking registrations for the tournament, so if you want to sign up before you hand your packet in, contact him at jonathan.magin@gmail.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet submission, eligibility, and fee schedule</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Guidelines for who is eligible to play ACF tournaments and packet submission can be found here: <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Fee schedule:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Base fee: $220</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$100 discount: January 23</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$50 discount: February 6</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> -$25 discount: February 20</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> No penalty: March 6</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$25 penalty: March 13</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> +$50 penalty: March 20</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">NOTE: No packets will be accepted later than two weeks before the tournament!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">ACF cannot make this any clearer: After the $50 deadline, you will owe the editors $10/day; if you cannot turn in a packet more than two weeks in advance of ACF Nationals, you will not be playing ACF Nationals. This is a hard and fast deadline and there will be no exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">This year, ACF also announces a 50 dollar discount for teams who write at least 20/20 that doesn’t need any major editing and submit their packet by the no penalty deadline. By major editing, we mean things like having to change many of the clues and/or answerlines and having to fix many grammatical errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">We would much rather give out lots of hefty discounts for excellent early packets than rake in money for late ones, so please take advantage of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Distribution:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Literature: This includes 1/1 American, 1/1 British, 1/1 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre (for instance, please don’t submit 5/5 on French literature or 5/5 poetry).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">5/5 History: This includes 1/1 American, 2/2 European, 1/1 World, and 1/1 Other (which can include any of the preceding categories). Please make sure that your questions aren’t all from the same time period or place and aren’t all one type of history (for instance, try not to submit 5/5 political history or 5/5 military history).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">5/5 Science: This includes 1/1 Biology, 1/1 Chemistry, 1/1 Physics, and 2/2 Other Science (including areas like Astronomy, Earth Science, Math, and Computer Science). Please don’t write two questions about the same scientific subdistribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">3/3 Arts: This includes 1/1 Painting, 1/1 Classical Music, and 1/1 Other (including Architecture, Sculpture, Opera, Jazz, Ballet/Dance, Art Film, and Photography). Please vary your questions by time, place, and genre.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">3/3 RMP: This includes 1/1 Religion, 1/1 Mythology, and 1/1 Philosophy. Please do not write both religion questions on the same religion or both mythology questions on the same myth system.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Social Science: This includes Psychology, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Linguistics, and Social Criticism. Please write your tossup and bonus on different areas of social science.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Geography/Current Events: These questions should be about different parts of the world. Geography questions that incorporate cultural and environmental clues instead of purely discussing physical features are particularly welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">1/1 Other Academic: This includes questions from every preceding category, as well as answers that don’t quite fit into any of the preceding categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Keep in mind that ACF Nationals does not have trash; if you submit any trash questions, they will simply be sent back.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">To reiterate, please vary the distribution of your questions. Last year, we had teams submit packets with both chemistry questions about the same narrow area, to present one example, and it would prevent many headaches if you make sure your questions are reasonably distributed. Also, please remember that while the goal of ACF Nationals is to determine the best team in the nation, writing primarily about extremely difficult topics is not the best way to achieve this, so please try to keep your fellow players in mind while choosing your answer lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">This announcement comes with ample time for everyone to start writing their Nationals packets and submit them as early as possible. We want to give you every opportunity to save money on this fantastic event and save us the trouble of having to edit a bunch of packets at the last minute. You should avail yourself of this chance posthaste.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">All packets should be sent to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:jonathan.magin@gmail.com">jonathan.magin@gmail.com</a>. If you have any questions about packet writing, you can send them to that email address also. Start writing!</span></p>
