<p><em>A friendly reminder: ACF editors will charge a </em><a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2014-15-packet-submission-guidelines/#additional"><em>penalty</em></a><em> if you do not meet the guidelines below. So pay close attention to this section. </em></p>
<h2>Content Formatting</h2>
<h3>Fonts, Margins, etc.</h3>
<p>Your submitted packet should be in Size 10 Times New Roman font. The margins should be 1 inch on all sides. The lines should be single spaced and spacing between paragraphs should be 0pt.</p>
<p><em>Do not number anything and do not use any tabs, autoformatting, or page breaks at any point in the document.</em></p>
<h3>Packet Header</h3>
<p>In the first two lines, place the following in <strong>bold text</strong>:</p>
<p>&lt;Tournament Name&gt; &lt;Year&gt;<br />
Packet by &lt;School Name&gt; &lt;Team Name or Letter&gt; (Player1, Player2, Player3, etc.)</p>
<p>You should include the names of all people who contributed to the packet and/or will be playing on that team. Eg.</p>
<p><strong>ACF Regionals 2014<br />
Packet by Reno Tech B (Travis Junior, Trudy Weigel, S. Jones, Jim Dangle)</strong></p>
<h3>Tossup formatting</h3>
<p>Tossups should be 6-7 lines in length, with the occasional tossup going into the 8<sup>th</sup> or 9<sup>th</sup> line. The last sentence of a tossup should begin with “For 10 points” (and not “FTP” or “F10P”) followed by a comma and a space.</p>
<p><em>Do not number or indent your tossups</em>. <em>Do not include power-marks in your tossups</em>.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Sample tossups</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Modified from 2008 ACF Fall packet by Cornell</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The Kidd glycoproteins present on the surface of these cells act as urea transporters. Spectrin and ankyrin are found in the cytoskeletal network of these cells and antibodies on their surface are detected by the direct Coombs test. They express high levels of CD47, which prevents phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen, and kidneys release EPO which stimulate the production of these. Excess production of them results in polycythemia, and their count is depressed in anemia. Produced in the bone marrow, they are biconcave and lack nuclei. For 10 points, identify these cells that contain hemoglobin, and help transport oxygen to tissues.<br />
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>red blood cell</strong></span>s [or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>RBC</strong></span>s; or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>erythrocyte</strong></span>s]</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">This group’s creation was inspired by the book <em>Stride Towards Freedom</em>. A speech critical of Kennedy’s planned civil rights bill was given during the March on Washington by its leader, John Lewis, who also oversaw the organization of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party for the 1964 Democratic Convention. Initially started in Greensboro, North Carolina, it was formally organized in a conference led by Ella Baker at Shaw University. After the Watts Riots, it began to reject civil rights legislation and was taken over by its militant branch. For 10 points, name this civil rights organization that supported “black power” under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael.<br />
ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee</strong></span> [or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>SNCC</strong></span>; or <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Snick</strong></span>]</p>
<h3>Bonus formatting</h3>
<p>Bonuses should have parts that are two lines long, with an occasional part that goes into the third line. Each bonus part begins on a new line with the numerical point value of that part in brackets.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Bonus leadin</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The first line of a bonus, the leadin, should include a description of the point values for the bonus parts. i.e., if it is a 3-part bonus, it should say “for 10 points each.”</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">If your bonus is structured so that each part is not worth 10 points (for example, if it contains a part that asks for two answers, each worth 5 points), make sure that the leadin indicates the variable structure, and that the part itself instructs the moderator and players of the point values. You leadin may say "For the stated number of points".</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Note: Do not submit very many, if any, bonuses with variable point structures.</em></p>
<h4 style="padding-left:30px;">Sample Bonuses</h4>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Modified from 2014 ACF Regionals packet by Northmont, Penn, and Chicago B</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>A regular bonus</em></p>

ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Seattle</strong></span>, Washington</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>A variable valued bonus</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The UCC generally treats these instruments as “firm offers.” For the stated number of points:<br />
[10] For 10 points, name these contracts in which one party pays for the opportunity to buy from the other or sell to the other at a set price for a period of time.<br />

ANSWER: <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>American</strong></span> style options</p>
<h3>Answer-line formatting</h3>
<p>The answer for any tossup or bonus part should be in its own line. The line should begin with the text “ANSWER: “; that is, the word “ANSWER” in all caps, followed by a colon and a space.</p>
<p>The required part of an answer should be <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>underlined and bolded</strong></span>. If the answer is the title of a work like a book, a play, an opera, a painting, a film, etc. <em>it should be italicized</em>. If it is something contained within a larger collection, e.g. a short story, a chapter, a song, etc. it should be contained within quotes.</p>
<p>Any instructions for prompts, alternate acceptable answers, or additional instructions for moderators should be contained within brackets.</p>
<h3>Standardization of numbers</h3>
<p>To make all the packets uniform in appearance, please display all point values and years in questions as digits, but all other numbers as prose words (e.g. “twenty-two years”, “a million dollars” and “fourteen hundred casualties,” but “For 10 points” and “1976.”)</p>
<p>Use the BCE/CE system instead of the BC/AD system for years, and remember to always include the correct designation alongside the years when there is the possibility of confusion.</p>
<h3>Other notes on formatting and grammar</h3>
<p>Please delete all internal notes and conversations from the packet before submitting it.</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">If there is a note that you would like to convey to the editors, please add it as a comment using MS Word, or leave a line before or after the question.</span></p>
<p><em>Do not use two spaces after a period, or anywhere else.</em></p>
<p><em>Avoid using special characters if possible</em>. Characters with accents and other diacritical marks are okay.</p>
<h2>Organizing your packet</h2>
<p>Group your questions by category (i.e. all lit questions go together, all history go together, and so on.) Within a category, all tossups should appear before bonuses. The ordering of the categories does not matter. Within a category, the ordering of sub-categories doesn’t matter, either.</p>
<p>Below is a sample packet ACF Editor Rob Carson and his teammate Bernadette Spencer submitted for ACF Regionals 2014. Please consult this document for an illustration of what a well-formatted submission looks like.<br />
