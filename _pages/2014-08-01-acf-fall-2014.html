<div class="content">
<p>Hi quizbowl,This is the official announcement for <span style="font-weight:bold;">ACF Fall 2014</span>. The tournament will be happening the weekend of <strong>11/8/2014</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;">This time is different</span></p>
<p>Over the last few years, there has been <a class="postlink" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=15109">some</a> <a class="postlink" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=12305">desire</a> to see the packet submission system changed. Particularly, we've seen that many teams who submit full packets never see their questions make it to the final set. We would like to see some change on that front.<br />
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;"><br />
What exactly is different?</span><br />
There are 3 things that are different:</p>
<p>-Full packets are <span style="font-weight:bold;">optional</span>. You will only be <span style="font-weight:bold;">required to submit half-packets</span>.<br />
-The <span style="font-weight:bold;">editors will tell you what distribution</span> your submissions should adhere to. We'll have a clear picture on how this will work pretty soon.<br />
-The discount/penalty schedule is slightly different pursuant to the half-packet requirement.</p>
<p>That's it.<br />
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;"><br />
I have questions about this new initiative. Who do I contact?</span><br />
Send emails to <a href="mailto:acffall14@gmail.com">acffall14@gmail.com</a> with any questions. We will be putting up an FAQ on this thread and on the website in the near future.</p>
<p>If you would prefer a public forum, please see <a class="postlink" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=16036">this thread</a> in the Collegiate Discussion section.<br />
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%;color:#ff0000;"><br />
Other details</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />
