<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Every team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2012 is required to submit a packet in order to play in Regionals. Please note that, like last year, this requirement also applies to eligible high school teams. Further information can be found at the ACF Packet Submission Guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The submission schedule for this tournament is: (note that these are Saturdays, not Sundays)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> December 21, 2013: -$50</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 4, 2014: -$25 (-$50 for optional packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 18, 2014: no penalty (-$25 for optional packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 1, 2014: +$25</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 8, 2014: +$50</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> After that: +$10 for each additional day you're late. Teams that are required to submit a packet and do not won't be allowed to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please submit your packet to acfregionals2014@gmail.com; the actual email with attached packet should include the phrase "[name of school + A/B/etc. if applicable) PACKET" in the subject line. In order to meet any particular deadline, your packet must be in our inbox by 11:59 pm PST on the stated day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties:</strong> Be sure to fully read the information contained in the Packet Guidelines. Any cases of incorrect formatting, plagiarism, or prohibited question types will result in hefty fees. The editors also reserve the right to send back any egregious cases to be fixed by the team in question, so be sure to do it right the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please submit all questions/comments/etc. regarding this event to acfregionals2014@gmail.com, or post them in the thread. Running packet list (with deadlines/penalties) will appear below as soon as packets begin to come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Distribution:</strong></span></p>
