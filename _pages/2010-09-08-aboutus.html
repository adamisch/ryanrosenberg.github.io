<h2><strong>So what’s ACF all about then?</strong></h2>
<p>Academic Competition Federation (ACF) is a non-incorporated, non-profit organization dedicated to providing high-quality quiz tournaments. We are entirely student and volunteer run. We pride ourselves on the highest standard of academic question writing and we keep the amount of pop culture (a.k.a. trash) or semi-academic questions to a minimum.</p>
<p>We offer three tournaments throughout the academic year:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACF Fall is an introductory-level event that is held in early November.</li>
<li>ACF Regionals is a “regular difficult” event that is held in January/February.  It serves as a qualifier for ACF Nationals.</li>
<li>ACF Nationals is the premier collegiate championship event. It is held in April. To participate in ACF Nationals, teams must qualify through their performance at ACF Regionals, or may apply for wildcard bids.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Sounds great! Who can play in ACF tournaments?</strong></h2>
<p>You and your teammates must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>all attending the same school, and</li>
<li>all taking at least one class for credit during the school year.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure whether you are eligible, you may write to <a href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/aboutus/2018-2019-officers/">ACF’s eligibility committee</a></p>
<p>“Mixed” teams (or “Masters” teams or “Chimera” teams), i.e. teams containing players not all from one school, or players who have graduated are not allowed to play. The head editor of the tournament may make an exception; however, these dispensations are made very limited circumstances. ACF reserves the right to disallow any team from playing at one of its tournaments.</p>
<h2><strong>How can I become an ACF Member?</strong></h2>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new editors. If you are interested in joining ACF, contact any one of the current ACF editors. You should be ready to show samples of your question-writing and/or editing work.</p>
