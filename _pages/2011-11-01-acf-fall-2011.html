<p><span style="color:#999999;">ACF Fall is still currently seeking a host for the Southeast site. Hosting is a good way to cut down on travel costs, raise money, and get newer members of your club exposed to well-written, accessible quizbowl questions. If you have any interest in hosting or questions about it, please refer first to the official <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/hosting-guidelines/2011-2012/">ACF Hosting Guidelines</a>, and then e-mail Carsten Gehring at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The deadline for bids is September 17, 2011. Bids will not be accepted after that point, and earlier bids will receive priority over later bids, all else being equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Submission</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> As per the ACF submission rules, any team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2010 is required to submit a packet in order to participate in an ACF tournament in 2011-2012. This includes ACF Fall. As of last year, high school players are now included in this definition and are subject to the same discounts and penalties as college teams. Teams required to submit packets who do not submit one by the final deadline will be dropped from the tournament.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please submit packets to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a> and use “ACF Fall 2011: [Team Name]” in the subject line. This year’s submission schedule is:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Packet submitted before 11:59 PM eastern time on:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 11, 2011: -$50</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> September 25, 2011: -$25 (-$50 for teams not required to submit packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 9, 2011: No penalty (-$25 for teams not required to submit packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 16, 2011: +$25</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> October 23, 2011: +$50</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Packet Penalties</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Teams will incur penalties for the following offenses:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Incorrect formatting: Please take a moment to review the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#formatting">ACF Packet Guidelines on formatting</a> to make sure you format your packet correctly.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch. Teams caught plagiarizing will be subject to large fines and possibly a thread not dissimilar to <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=6868&amp;start=0">this one</a>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#999999;">Writing specific types of forbidden questions: Types of questions prohibited at ACF events include spelling questions, binary matching bonuses, and 5-10-15 bonuses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please see the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/#additional">additional packet penalties section</a> for more info.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>Friendly Reminders</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Please refer to the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acfquizbowl.wordpress.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Guidelines</a> document for more detailed explanations of packet submission and fee-related information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If you are sending multiple packet writing teams, PLEASE make sure you don’t collaborate on your packets or talk about their contents.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2011 is the same as it has been for the past four years, such as can be seen in ACF Fall 2009 and ACF Fall 2010. These tournaments can be found on <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a>. Remember above all that the tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before, in both your answerlines and your selection of clues. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">If you have any other questions, please let Carsten know at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:OctagonJoe@gmail.com">OctagonJoe@gmail.com</a>.</span></p>
