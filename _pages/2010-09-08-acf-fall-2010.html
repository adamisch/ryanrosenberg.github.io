<li><span style="color:#999999;">Plagiarism: Please do not attempt to plagiarize. It is often very easy to catch.

<p><span style="color:#999999;"><!-- m -->The difficulty level of ACF Fall 2010 is the same as that of the last two years, so teams are encouraged to follow the difficulty levels of ACF Fall 2008 and ACF Fall 2009. Those tournaments can be found here: <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/">http://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><!-- m -->Remember above all that this tournament is supposed to be accessible to new teams who have never played quizbowl before. If you suspect one of your answer choices may be too hard, it probably is.</span></p>
