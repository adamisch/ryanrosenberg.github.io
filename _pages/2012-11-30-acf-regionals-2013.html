<p><strong>NOTE: THIS IS AN ARCHIVED PAGE</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">This is the official global announcement for ACF Regionals 2013, which will take place on February 23, 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Editors:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Head Editor: Chris Ray (Maryland)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Co-Editors: John Lawrence (King's College London), Cody Voight (VCU), Rob Carson (Ball So Hard University)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Hosts:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Note that we are now actively seeking hosts in most regions - please contact us at <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a> if you're interested. Bids will remain open for two weeks before we begin running down sites ourselves, so please indicate your interest ASAP if you'd like first crack at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">West: UCSD</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Pacific Northwest:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> South: Rice</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Southeast: University of South Carolina</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Great Lakes: Chicago</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Midwest: WUStL</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> East Canada/Niagara: University of Toronto</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Mid-Atlantic: University of Maryland</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Northeast: Brown</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">We may add or condense certain sites depending on how bids shake out to make sure we're making the best choices possible for the most teams. In particular, interested parties in that whole Midwest Regionals thing should contact me and explain to me what consensus (if any) was reached on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Packet Submission:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Every team with at least one person on it who played a regular, collegiate, academic quizbowl tournament prior to September 1, 2011 is required to submit a packet in order to play in Regionals. Please note that, like last year, this requirement also applies to eligible high school teams. Further information can be found at the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/packet-submission-guidelines/">ACF Packet Submission Guidelines</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">The submission schedule for this tournament is:</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> December 30, 2012: -$50</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 13, 2013: -$25 (-$50 for optional packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> January 27, 2013: no penalty (-$25 for optional packets)</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 3, 2013: +$25</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> February 10, 2013: +$50</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> After that: My unending wrath, +$100, and a guarantee you will be dropped from the field if you haven't negotiated an extension before then.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Payment Deadline (NEW): February 16, 2013 (your payment must be postmarked by this date).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please submit your packet to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a>; the actual email with attached packet should include the phrase "[name of school + A/B/etc. if applicable) PACKET" in the subject line. In order to meet any particular deadline, your packet must be in our inbox by 11:59 pm PST on the stated day.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">As alluded to above, extensions *may* be granted after the final February 10 deadline, but are at my discretion and will certainly not be granted if the request appears mysteriously at 11:58 pm the night of the deadline.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Packet Penalties: Be sure to fully read the information contained in the <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/2012-13-packet-submission-guidelines/">Packet Guidelines</a>. Any cases of incorrect formatting, plagiarism, or prohibited question types will result in hefty fees. The editors also reserve the right to send back any egregious cases to be fixed by the team in question, so be sure to do it right the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please note that in cases of plagiarism in particular, I have now graded many a term paper and edited many a tournament, and I will catch you. This is doubtless because if you have decided to plagiarize from past questions/wikipedia/wherever, you are an idiot; I encourage you to cut your losses with that rather than compounding the situation with plagiarism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">New in 2013</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please note that ACF Regionals, like all ACF events, is using the new centralized payment system this year. Some updates will be made, but the general information on how this worked for ACF Fall are available in <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=13640">this thread</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Also note the change in Division II eligibility rules (also in place for ACF Fall), as announced <a style="color:#999999;" href="http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=13640">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Please submit all questions/comments/etc. regarding this event to <a style="color:#999999;" href="mailto:ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com">ACFRegionals2013@gmail.com</a>, or post them in the thread. Running packet list (with deadlines/penalties) will appear below as soon as packets begin to come in.</span></p>
