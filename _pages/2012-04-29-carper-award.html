<p>The Dr. N. Gordon Carper Lifetime Achievement Award was established in 1999 to honor individuals for meritorious services in sustaining and enriching collegiate academic competitions. Former Georgia Tech luminary Al Whited modeled the Carper on the Fermi Award. The award is presented annually to a member of the quizbowl community who exhibits the kind of dedication to and long-term support of academic competitions as exemplified by career of Dr. Carper. The Carper Award, while sponsored by the Academic Competition Federation, is not limited to individuals with ACF affiliations.</p>
