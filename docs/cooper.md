The [Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award](http://www.pace-nsc.org/2018-cooper-award-winners/) is an annual award presented by PACE to recognize “a high school academic competition team member, advisor, or organization whose character best promotes the spirit and honor of quiz bowl competition”.  The original Cooper Award was named in honor of Benjamin Cooper, a student at Georgetown Day School who had been named captain of his team prior to his untimely death on August 12, 1997, and has been awarded at every NSC since PACE’s foundation.  In 2004, PACE added the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award, which specifically recognizes the contributions of persons under the age of 25. Many winners of the “Young Cooper” award are high school or college students at the time they are recognized. 

This year, PACE would like to recognize the following individuals for their work on expanding and improving high school quizbowl at the local and national levels.  

The Academic Ambassador Award will be presented to Chad Kubicek in recognition of his work as tournament-hosting contact for NAQT, promoting the spread of quiz bowl across the country.

The Young Ambassador Award will be presented to Kady Hsu of Rancho Bernardo High School in recognition of her work to organize and expand the tournament circuit in Southern California.

These awards will be presented at the opening meeting of the 2018 PACE NSC, on Saturday, June 2 in Reston, VA. Please join me in congratulating both winners and thanking them for their work to improve the quiz bowl community.

Congratulations to Chad and Kady! We at PACE thank you for all your hard work building the high school quizbowl circuit.
