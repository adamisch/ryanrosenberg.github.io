**Roster**: 

Maximilian Shatan (Senior, headed to Wesleyan University)

Lev Bernstein (Senior, headed to New York University)

Maya Rubin (Senior, headed to Wellesley)

Cade Aguda (Senior, headed to Northwestern University in Qatar)





**Team Notes**

Playing since only February 2017 (anno domini), Bard (not “Brad”) has established itself as a pretty rad team that does quizbowl things. With a superclassic lineup of Maximilian Shatan (the cool one), Lev Bernstein (the fun one), Christopher Stauffer (the tall one), and Cade Aguda (the nice one), Bard has made a name for itself by doing pretty darn well, and not much else except for internet stuff but this is real life Morpheus you trickster you. Our main goals at PACE-NSC are as follows: tricking another team into incorrectly answering a bounceback using tinfoil alone, powering a tossup by going back in time and writing the tossup ourselves in Superspacetime ink, and making new friends (this one is honest.) We love playing and sometimes winning, and we can't wait to compete at PACE. Shoutout to Dr. Despommier for being a cool and rad advisor.


## Hunter A

Coach: Caitlin Samuel

**Roster**: 

Chloe Levine (Senior, headed to Harvard)

Samuel Brochin (Senior, headed to University of Pittsburgh)

Gilad Avrahami (Senior, headed to Haverford)

Brian Lu (Junior)





**Team Notes**

Hunter A is a rather amorphous team which has been described by numerous rosters throughout the year, but right now, we are Chloe Levine (Captain and President), Sam Brochin (Senior Advisor), Gilad Avrahami (Middle School Director), and Brian Lu (Treasurer). Yeah, that's right: We've all got named positions. Join Hunter QB because we got you for college apps. Anyway, we're stoked to be back at PACE. It's Chloe's favorite tournament. (Also, it's Sam's least favorite tournament, but we'll ignore that part.) Chloe, Sam, and Gilad were three members of a five-person B Team at PACE 2015 which dubbed itself the Freshman Five and has been not just a group of friends throughout high school but also an invaluable support network, and we're glad to be back where at least two of us feel our personal connection to Quiz Bowl began. Chloe is really hoping to power another question on The Stone Breakers this year, because that would provide some nice closure. In conclusion, this certainly isn't the team we thought we'd be bringing, but we're really glad it ended up this way, and we can't wait to finish off the season alongside our friends and our amazing advisor, Ms. Samuel. Thanks for answering our late night texts about misogyny, Ms. S. Go Hawks!


## Hunter B

Coach: Caitlin Samuel

**Roster**: 

David Godovich (Senior, headed to SUNY Binghamton)

Asher Jaffe (Sophomore)

Rachel Yang (Freshman)

Cerulean Ozarow (Freshman)

Ella Leeds (Freshman)



**Team Notes**

Hunter B is a lean, mean powerin' machine. We hope you're ready for 'em. We've got not one but two mythology specialists (the formidable David Godovich, who is Team Captain, and the smaller but still formidable Rachel Yang), an NAQT-lover ready to prove he won't be fooled by PACE's long sentences (Cerulean Ozarow), an animal sciences specialist and member of the high-ranking Hunter JV History Bowl Team (Ella Leeds), and a.... Well, we're not sure what to call Asher Jaffe, but with his stats and his very exciting hair, we're pretty sure he's going to beat you to the buzzer at least once. With the exception of David, all of the team's players are sophomores or freshmen, so they've got a bright, bright future ahead. But that doesn't mean they're not going to seize the opportunity for brightness now! Look out, friends and foes alike! Hide your stat lines! Here they come!





## Island Trees High School

Coach: Ludgero Medeiros

**Roster**: 

David Wendt (Junior)

Jonathan Garcia (Senior, headed to Stony Brook University)

Thomas Zamroz (Junior)

Kenneth Chan (Senior, headed to Boston University)

Joshua Kim (Junior)



**Team Notes**

The Island Trees Academic Team worked hard in the 2017-2018 school year to kick it up a notch and take on some of the toughest teams in the New York area. With that aim in mind, Island Trees has had a successful season, placing third in the inaugural Bard Bowl and finishing fourth as the smallest school among the finalists in the Long Island Regional Quiz Bowl. Led by Junior captain David Wendt, the Island Trees squad played in all three legs of the Columbia Cup, and finished strongly in the Long Island Fall Tournament hosted by Kellenberg High School. With a strong crop of players coming back for senior year, Island Trees will be a force to reckon with in the 2018-2019 academic year.

Coach: Benjamin Kirk

**Roster**: 

Isaiah Gutman (Junior)

Kaelan Imani (Sophomore)

Vaynu Kadiyali (Junior)

Julian Perry (Junior)





**Team Notes**

This team of juniors and sophomores had big shoes to fill after last year's Ithaca A team, but they've done an awesome job getting there, continuing Ithaca’s reputation of being the dominant team in Upstate New York. We’re leading the way in growing Quizbowl regionally, hosting two tournaments during the year and participating in others locally, but we’re not afraid to hop a bus and head downstate or to Pennsylvania or New Jersey, never coming back without at least a top bracket placement! The team has been working hard and are excited to see how they do at this year’s PACE NSC!

Vishwa Shanmugam (Senior, headed to University of Maryland College Park)

Rohan Vora (Senior, headed to NYU Stern)

Anish Gadgil (Junior)

Max Lind (Freshman)





**Team Notes**

Downingtown STEM is a strange team. Joining the pyramidal scene in the beginning of 2017, they quickly became a strong contender and grew their clout within the community. They are led by generalist Vishwa, who is known for handing out Black Forest Organic™ gummy bears to anyone who asks and putting up impressive neg numbers. Their history specialist, Anish, is renowned for his hot takes and incessant whining, while arts specialist Rohan is a notable buzzer rock and overall snake. They are joined by rookie lit specialist Max, who, as a freshman, has already proven himself at multiple tournaments. STEM’s pyramidal journey has had its ups and downs, hard-earned wins and crushing defeats, first-place finishes and finals blowouts, but, most importantly, they’re glad to have met the awesome people and made the great friends that they did. (Hi Max!)

**Team Notes**

The New Horizons Governor’s School for Science and Technology team of Jenny Gu, James Harrington, Lewis McAllister, Rachel McNamara, Kate Perkins, and Jakob Weiss, was just formed this year. The first quiz bowl NHGS attended was the MVGS Open at the Mountain Vista Governor’s School. The team took a lot of lessons from that competition, for many it was the first quiz bowl they had attended in that format. A few weeks later, New Horizons competed in William & Mary’s second annual James Blair bowl. The senior team won second place at that event, with 3 members earning honors as top 10 scorers. It has been an honor to compete this year as the team heads off to BC, Harvard, Harvey Mudd, U of Alabama and UVA.  The team would especially like to thank their coach Dr. Woo for making this all possible.
